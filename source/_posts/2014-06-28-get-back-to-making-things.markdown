David Lang is a maker. After a stint with a struggling Silicon Valley startup, David teamed up with former NASA engineer [Eric Stackpole](http://openrov.com/profile/1gupl83kvnk8f) to build an underwater robot called [OpenROV](/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/). That's a two-sentence oversimplification of David's maker journey, detailed in his book: [Zero to Maker: Learn (Just Enough) to Make (Just About) Anything](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028284.do). 

The book starts off like a novel, with the exploration of the mysterious Hall City Cave and an 1840s-era gold robbery. Fast-forward to the present day where a multi-disciplinary team of makers joins together to create an inexpensive vehicle for underwater exploration.
