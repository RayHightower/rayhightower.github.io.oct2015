Early adopters on Apple's Mac OS X and iOS platforms flock to [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com/), a multi-city conference for developers. Tickets are slightly easier to get than [WWDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wwdc); CocoaConf consistently sells out. 

CocoaConf's presenters are practicing developers, actively building real software every day. They come to CocoaConf to share their experiences in a powerful upward-spiral of technical learning. Here are a few highlights from the latest CocoaConf, held March 7-8 near Chicago.

###Customers Will Pay for Services
[Justin Williams](https://twitter.com/justin) kicked things off with a keynote titled _10 Things I Think I Think_. Justin recently acquired [Glassboard](http://glassboard.com/), so his developer skills are blended with the insights of a business owner. His list of ten included one approach to making money from mobile apps: Forget about selling a million copies in the App Store. Instead, create a service, charge a monthly fee for the service, and give the app away for free so customers can engage with the service. When customers are served well, they will pay.

###Effective iOS 7 Networking
Customer-focused mobile apps usually communicate with other software via the web. [Ben Scheirman](http://twitter.com/subdigital) shared his experiences in building iOS apps that communicate with web services. Several questions are raised when we build apps like this, namely:

* How do you ensure communication without sacrificing performance? 
* If the mobile app requests information from a web service, and the service is unavailable (or slow) how do you avoid frustrating the user? 

A new class in iOS 7, `NSURLSession`, lets us upload and download in the background. Users are kept happy because the app continues to interact with them. Scheirman's [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/subdigital/effective-network-programming-in-ios-7) and [sample code](https://github.com/subdigital/mods-2013) provide more details.

###Xcode Walkabout
Most of my iOS time is spent with [Vim]() and [RubyMotion]().


###SpriteKit
How do we manage images without doing all of the work from scratch?


###Parallel Computing with OpenCL
The parallel computing talk by [Jeff Biggus]()was the most mind-blowing session of CocoaConf, for me. Maybe it's because WisdomGroup is working Perhaps this is because of WisdomGroup's work with [high performance computing](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/case-studies/texas-am-university/).



###The Klein Family
CocoaConf is run by Dave and Debbie Klein and their 14 children. [About The Family Behind CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com/family) gives details.

Thank you, Klein family, for another great CocoaConf!
