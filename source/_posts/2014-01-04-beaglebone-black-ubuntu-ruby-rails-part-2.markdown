Episode one of this series shows [how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black](/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/). This post covers the installation of the Ubuntu GUI, Ruby, and Rails.

Node.js bonus: Rails requires a JavaScript runtime, and Node.js offered the quickest way to fulfill this requirement. Details appear within.

###Gotcha: Partition Size
At the end of part one, the Bone successfully booted with the Ubuntu command line interface. Now it's time to add the GUI. Two things to know about the Ubuntu GUI installation:

* The partition created on the SD card is not large enough to hold the Ubuntu GUI. No problem. The SD card has some extra room, and we can re-size the partition. 
* GUI installation only takes a single line command, but it takes an hour to download, compile, and install all of the GUI libraries.

If we try to install the GUI without re-sizing the partition, the
installation will fail about halfway through and we will have wasted
half an hour. So let's re-size first.

###Re-Sizing the Partition
Why didn't the partition have the right size when we downloaded the image file? Good question.

My guess: The image file was designed to be as small as possible in order to minimize download time. I plan to test this theory by creating a new image with a larger size and a pre-installed GUI. If the test is successful, results will be posted on this blog. If the mission fails, then the secretary will disavow any knowledge...

To re-size the partition, do the following:


###Installing the Ubuntu GUI
After the partition on the SD card has been resized, this single command will intall the GUI. Note that the process takes about an hour:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
```
When installation and compilation are complete, Ubuntu will return to the command prompt. Here's how to reboot:

```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

Several minutes later, the Ubuntu 12 GUI will appear. Congratulations!


###Gotcha: Running RVM
RVM didn't want to behave, initially. Then I learned, from the RVM site, thatâ€¦
> For RVM to work properly, you have to set the 'Run command as login shell' checkbox on the Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal's Settings page.

Here's the checkbox mentioned in the quote, highlighted with a red rectangle:

Details are in the brief article [Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal](http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal).

###Gotcha: Ruby Installation
Nonconclusive, but I should mention it here: My Ruby installation (with RVM) initially failed because the BBB went into power save mode during installation. On my second Ruby installation attempt, I kept the machine awake by moving the mouse. The same tactic worked with the Rails installation.

###Gotcha: Rails Installation
Rails needs a JavaScript runtime in order to function. There are two ways to meet this requirement: 

* Install NodeJS, or 
* Install `therubyracer` gem. 

Installing `therubyracer` gem did not work for me. But NodeJS installed quickly, like so:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```


###JavaScript Runtime Required for Rails 4.0

$ sudo apt-get install nodejs





###NodeJS Dependency?


###Conclusion
The BeagleBone Black is a cool option for running Ubuntu. Yes, it runs slower than a typical laptop. But how many laptops can be purchased for $45? This Ubuntu/BeagleBone Black combination lets us run Linux on a $45 computer. Amazing.
