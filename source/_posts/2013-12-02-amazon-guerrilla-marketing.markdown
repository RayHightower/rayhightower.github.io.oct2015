Last night's episode of 60 Minutes featured an interview with Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. Perfect timing for Amazon. Black Friday was a few days ago. Cyber Monday is today. Online retailers want to be top-of-mind with every potential customer on the day when people are likely to spend money.

###Amazon's Surprise: Drones
Bezos unveiled a surprise for interviewer Charlie Rose: Amazon Prime Air. In one sentence, [Amazon Prime Air](http://www.amazon.com/b?ref_=tsm_1_tw_s_amzn_mx3eqp&node=8037720011) will deliver most Amazon products in thirty minutes or less using a fleet of octocopter drones.

###Geurrilla Marketing
[Jay Conrad Levinson](http://www.gmarketing.com/ ), author of _Geurilla Marketing_, would applaud this move by Amazon. Amazon Prime Air is two years away at the earliest, largely because it depends on flying vehicles which have not yet received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval. By unveiling the drones now, Bezos achieves several things:

* Buzz. Everybody is talking about Amazon on Cyber Monday.
* Political influence. Some of the people feeling the buzz are FAA officials.
* Continued top-of-mind awareness. Long after Cyber Monday, the excitement of the drone idea will carry on.

Congratulations, Amazon team, for a well-executed Geurilla Marketing move.
