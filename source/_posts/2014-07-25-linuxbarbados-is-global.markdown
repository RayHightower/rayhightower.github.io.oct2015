LinuxBarbados offers solid knowledge for anyone who wants to ramp up their open source skills. For example, yesterday’s meeting featured a presentation on [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) by Michael Layne. The presenter dug deep into the tool, offering tips on how to write plugins in C++ or Python. 

###Global Reach
The group is based in the Barbados on the campus of the University of the West Indies. Enthusiasts who don’t live in Barbados can participate _live_ online. So far the group has used Google Hangout for video. Other video solutions will be considered as the group continues to grow.

###Next Steps
Organizers [Maurice Beckles](http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/143194822/) and [Micheal Layne](http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/153574612/) have exciting plans for the group. Take a look at the LinuxBarbados calendar, and join [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org) online if you want to be notified about future events.

We look forward to seeing you!
