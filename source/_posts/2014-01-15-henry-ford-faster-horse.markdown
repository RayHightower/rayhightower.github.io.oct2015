>If Iâ€™d asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a faster horse. 
>&nbsp;
>~Henry Ford

The above Henry Ford quote is often cited in presentations about innovation. The innovator who listens to customers too closely will only achieve incremental improvements, because they'll be solving problems with old tools. 

That's one way to interpret the quote. Last night, I was introduced to another view.

###Parse the Quote Differently
Last night's [IxDA Chicago meeting](http://www.ixdachicago.org) featured a presentation by [Chris Holmes](http://chris-holmes.com), who shared a different view of the Ford quote. Yes, if an inventor sets out to create a faster horse, the odds of innovation are zero.

However, if we focus on the adjective _faster_ instead of the noun _horse_, we might achieve something. The adjective tells us what the customer wants to accomplish. The noun tells how they want to accomplish it. The problem is that the noun is based on what the customer currently knows about the world. in the late 1800s, tha t world was all about horses.

###Focus on Faster 
_Faster_ tells us that we can stretch beyond our current thinking and consider other modes of transportation. Focusing on _faster_ leads to the beginning of the automobile industry.

Thanks IxDA Chicago and Chris Holmes for a powerful insight.
