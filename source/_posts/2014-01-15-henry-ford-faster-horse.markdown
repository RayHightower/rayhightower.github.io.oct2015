>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a faster horse. 
>&nbsp;
>~Henry Ford

The above Henry Ford quote is often cited in presentations about innovation. The point of the quote: An inventor who listens to customers too closely, without observing customer behavior, will reap tiny improvements. Ford challenged the assumtion that horseback was the only way to travel. That is how Ford became a leader in the early automotive industry.

That's the traditional way to interpret Ford's quote. Last night, I was introduced to another view.

###Parse the Quote Differently
Last night's [IxDA Chicago meeting](http://www.ixdachicago.org) featured a presentation by [Chris Holmes](http://chris-holmes.com), who shared a different view of the Ford quote. Yes, if we focus on improving the speed of horses, very little improvement can be achived.

However, if we focus on the adjective _faster_ instead of the noun _horse_, the customer's words will direct us to the opportunity for innovation. The adjective tells us what the customer wants to accomplish. The noun tells how they want to accomplish it. The noun is the customer's "solution" based on what they currently know about the world. In the late 1800s, the world was all about horses.

###Focus on Faster 
_Faster_ tells us that we can stretch beyond our current thinking and consider other modes of transportation. Focusing on _faster_ leads to the beginning of the automobile industry.

Thanks IxDA Chicago and Chris Holmes for the insight.
