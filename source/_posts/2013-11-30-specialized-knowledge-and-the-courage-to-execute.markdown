Boy Scout [Troop 534](http://troop534.org) "Hey!" asked me to speak at the Troop's annual reunion breakfast this year. This was a major honor for me because I grew up in the troop, I currently serve as one of the adult leaders, and the breakfast organizers normally invite an outsider to speak. Why listen to someone who you get to see on a regular basis? I took the speaking invitation as a challenge to come up with some new material.

###Three Stories
Teenagers are a tough audience. I chose to approach them with three stories centered around the them of _Specialized Knowledge and the Courage to Execute_. Boring title, eh? But the three stories appealed to the group. Here's a summary of the first story:

A tractor maker makes a life-changing decision when the founder of the Ferrarri motor company, Mr. Ferrari himself, pisses him off.

Here's the 11-minute video. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you Troop 534 "Hey!" for having me!
