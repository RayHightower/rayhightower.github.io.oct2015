How many motors are in the typical automobile? The knee-jerk response might be “one, the big metal thing under the hood”. Upon further reflection, we may recall the motors that operate many devices in today’s automobile: windshield wipers, power windows, door locks, sun roof, reclining seats, and so on. Power devices were once luxury equipment. Today, since motors have fallen in price, most cars include these _luxury_ items as standard equipment.

We take the motors for granted, therefore the motors have disappeared. And now, as it becomes possible to add an IP address to almost any electronic device, we bring about the Internet of Things (IoT). Computers are disappearing too.

###ACM Presents IoT Trends
Steven Loving is a director at [Arrayent](http://www.arrayent.com/), which makes a platform for companies that want their products to be IoT-aware. Steven shared his vision of the IoT future at [Tuesday's ACM meeting](http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/184091062/). The presentation was full of ideas that 

###Don't Leave Home Without It
_Don't leave home without it_ was once the catch phrase of a major charge card. Today, many of us leave home with just three things in our pockets:

* Wallet
* Keys
* Smart phone

As near-field communication (or one of its descendants) becomes prevalent, we may only need the smartphone. 



###What's Next
If we know where the puck is headed, what can we as developers and engineers do to get there first? The major smartphone makers get it. Apple's





Computers are traveling along a similar path toward invisibility. How many computers are in they typical home? Microcomputers control household devices  like the dishwasher, microwave oven, thermostat, security system, and television. Many of these devices run embedded Linux and they have IP addresses. They are internet aware. 

As the Internet of Things (IoT) makes the many computers around us invisible, how can developers benefit from this trend?
