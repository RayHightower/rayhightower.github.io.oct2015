How many motors are in the typical automobile? The knee-jerk response might be “one, the big metal thing under the hood”. Upon further reflection, we may recall the motors that operate many devices in today’s automobile: windshield wipers, power windows, door locks, sun roof, reclining seats, and so on. Power devices were once luxury equipment. Today, since motors have fallen in price, most cars include these _luxury_ items as standard equipment.

We take the motors for granted, therefore the motors have disappeared. And now, as it becomes possible to add an IP address to almost any electronic device, we bring about the Internet of Things (IoT). Computers are disappearing too.

Computers are traveling along a similar path toward invisibility. How many computers are in they typical home? Microcomputers control household devices  like the dishwasher, microwave oven, thermostat, security system, and television. Many of these devices run embedded Linux and they have IP addresses. They are internet aware. 

As the Internet of Things (IoT) makes the many computers around us invisible, how can developers benefit from this trend?
