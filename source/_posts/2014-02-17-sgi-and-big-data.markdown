[Silicon Graphics International Corporation (SGI)](http://sgi.com) built the computers that rendered special effects for the original [Jurassic Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)). SGI machines were coveted by computer enthusiasts throughout the 1990s. Eventually, Moore's Law, x86 architecture, and Linux made it possible for commodity PCs to perform as well as SGI's premium workstations. Wall Street traders and other power users abandoned workstations in favor of Linux. Makers of premium workstations, like SGI, fell on hard times.

SGI is back. The company is blending x86, Linux, and (buzzword alert) Big Data to attack the high performance computing market.

###About Chicago ACM
[The Chicago Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (Chicago ACM)](http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/) is on fire. December's meeting featured a supercomputing presentation from [Sharan Kalwani of Fermilab](). This month's meeting featured SGI and Big Data, and next month will focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). What an exciting combination. Looking forward to more!
