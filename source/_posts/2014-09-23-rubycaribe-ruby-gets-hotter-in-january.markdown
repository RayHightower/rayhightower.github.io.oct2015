[RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) (pronounced ka-REEB) is the most exciting event ever created by WisdomGroup. The conference will be held January 27 - 31, 2015 in Barbados. January is a beautiful time to visit the Caribbean, especially if you’re coming from a colder part of the planet.

Intermediate and advanced software developers will find RubyCaribe valuable because...

* Each RubyCaribe session features a 30- to 45-minute presentation followed by a 2-hour deep-dive lab. Learning is reinforced throughout.
* The venue, [Hilton Barbados Resort](http://www.hiltonbarbadosresort.com/), sits right on the ocean. Need a stretch break? Take a walk on the beach!

###Bonus: OpenROV
{% imgcap right /images/openrov-uw.jpg OpenROV. Linux and Node.js. %}
You and your RubyCaribe colleagues will hack together on [OpenROV](/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/), an open source underwater robot running Linux and Node.js. The best developers are polyglot, right? On Friday afternoon, we will grab a boat for live ocean testing with a few OpenROVs. If you ever wanted to experiment with Node.js and IoT, RubyCaribe offers a great opportunity.

###University Collaboration
On Saturday, the final day of RubyCaribe, we will visit the [University of the West Indies at Cave Hill](http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/). Faculty and students from the UWI community will demo their work with solar energy and other areas touched by software. Who knows, maybe you’ll give a lightning talk about something you learned at RubyCaribe!

###Make Your Brain Sweat
RubyCaribe will work you hard. RubyCaribe will make your brain sweat. So be sure to schedule a few days before or after the conference for sight seeing and relaxation. Rum was invented in Barbados.
