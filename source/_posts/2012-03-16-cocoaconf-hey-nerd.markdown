"Hey Nerd!"
 

I had just walked into the hotel bar at CocoConf, currently underway in a Chicago suburb. A table full of wise guys (Three Stooges, not Sopranos) called out to someone named Nerd.
 

"Hey Nerd!" they shouted again.
 

This time I looked at their lanyards and badges. Same as mine. They were talking to me. Complete strangers, but not for long because they invited me to join their table. I was immediately comfortable when the discussion turned to midichlorian levels and the lego version of the Millenium Falcon. Camaraderie like this is why I go to conferences.
 

Earlier that day I listened to the author of a popular iPad app as he described the challenges of writing 3D graphics code. The latest version of Apple's tablet gets delivered today, so this conference full of Mac developers is pumped! Discussions like this are why I go to conferences.
 

It's a little after 5am as I type this blog entry. I'm excited about the presentations scheduled for this morning, so excited that I had to get up a few hours early just to write about it. Excitement like this is why I go to conferences.
 

My team runs conferences (WindyCityGo happens in April) and I'm at CocoConf because developers are part of a bigger community with a common goal: Getting better at what we do. Books and videos are a good start. Classes are helpful. But beyond the standard learning tools, sometimes a good one-on-one discussion with a fellow dev will help both people to look at a concept in a fresh way. To solve a knotty problem. To resolve a debate about midichlorian levels.
 

Everybody learns when we share ideas. Go CocoaConf!
