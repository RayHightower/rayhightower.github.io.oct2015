Here is an early draft of the [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) Code of Conduct:

>WindyCityRails strives to provide a healthy, harassment-free conference experience for all attendees. Our Code of Conduct, which has been practiced by members of our community for years, is as follows: Treat everyone at the conference as you would want yourself, a family member, or an esteemed colleague to be treated. Our community is stronger when every member contributes to the safety and learning of the other members. We are colleagues, and we treat each other with respect.

The organizer team may do some word-smithing and typo-correction this week, but the final version will essentially read as it appears above. Key objectives achieved:

   * Simplicity. The point is made with minimal words.
   * Inclusiveness. Everybody who wants to learn and engage is included. 
   * Respect. Everybody is treated with respect. No threats are made.

You have already read the most important part of this post. The rest tells how the code came to be.

###First Person Singular
Normally, when discussing WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby, I shine the light on the organizers as a team (we) rather than on myself. WindyCityRails is blessed with a great team of organizers. We pool our talents to deliver a great conference experience for everyone.

However, when concerns are raised, the buck stops with the team leader: me. Please forgive me for using first person pronouns throughout this post. Also, other members of the organizer team may have opinions that differ from mine. If I say anything here that disturbs you, please know that it comes from me directly. I am the only one at fault.

###Knee-Jerk Response
Last week a Twitter user asked if WindyCityRails had a code of conduct. I responded (through the @WindyCityRails handle) with a one-word answer: No. 

Why the terse response? Because I have a deep bias against bureaucracy. A code of conduct sounds like a big ball of bureaucracy coiled up in a heaping helping of red tape. 

Other inquiries followed via Twitter and email. All were helpful. Some people offered sample text from other events. Thanks to these sources, I've spent the last few days reviewing codes and guidelines used by others. Most of what they offer is good.

Fortunately, other members of the organizer team (thank you [Ginny
Hendry](https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry) and [Justin Love](https://twitter.com/wondible)) encouraged me to think differently. I
needed to study this. That is how I've spent the past few days.

###Simplicity
In drafting text for WindyCityRails (and, by extension, ChicagoRuby) I tried to create something that fits our culture. We are an inclusive group that treats people well.

At the same time, it is important to keep the word count low. 140 characters would be ideal!

###Inclusiveness
The WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby communities have always been inclusive. Even as we grow, we strive to maintain our inclusiveness.

Here's an example. Before I became an organizer of ChicagoRuby, I heard that a group of developers met for drinks after every meeting. I always heard about the gathering days afterwards. I could have taken this personally, but I later realized that the group was not intentionally excluding me. They just didn't know me. Further, they were so caught up in their discussions that it simply never occurred to them to invite people they didn't know.

That changed when I became an organizer. Today we announce the drink invitation at the beginning of each meeting, and we post it with every meeting announcement. Brand new people are made to feel welcome.

Further, we make it clear that one does not have to drink alcohol to participate. Soft drinks and cranberry juice are in abundance.

Another example of inclusiveness: All of ChicagoRuby's monthly events are free because we want to include developers regardless of income. Expenses for the monthly events are covered by revenue from WindyCityRails and monthly sponsors. 

###Excluding Others
I have more experience with racism than any other -ism, so that's what I'll talk about here. 

A mentor of mine raised two questions during a discussion about racism and oppression. 

   * Do you want to end all oppression, or just the oppression directed at you?

   * Do you really want to end oppression, or do you simply want to change places with your oppressor?

When drafting the new code of conduct, I wanted to be sure to treat all groups of people with respect. A few decades ago, when I was a young developer for a company in Colorado, I had a confrontation with senior developer, a White man. I won't go into details, but I was fairly sure that this was a Black/White issue. And I will admit that I treated that White man very badly in retaliation.

Some days later, I walked past my manager's desk, and there was my "nemesis", interacting with my manager (another White man who also happened to be his manager) in the same manner that he had interacted with me. That's when I figured out that this guy wasn't a racist, he was just an asshole.

And, because of the way I had treated him, I was the one guilty of racism.

In drafting the WindyCityRails code of conduct, it was important to not treat any group better than another. All groups must be treated with respect, not just my own.

###Respect
I was disturbed by the language in some of the sample codes of conduct. It took me awhile to figure out what bothered me. And then it hit me: The tone seemed threatening. To paraphrase: "Follow these rules or we will kick you out and take away your money." 

Colleagues don't threaten each other.

Some may point out that without a method of enforcement, the code has no teeth. They're right, there are no teeth. However, I don't believe that "teeth" or threats are needed amongst colleagues. Colleagues treat each other with respect.

###Conclusion
There you have itâ€¦ my opinion. Can my opinion change? Perhaps. I have many blind spots, and that is why I am sharing my reasoning here. I look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments below or over a cup of coffee.

By the way, the [WindyCityRails call for proposals](http://www.windycityrails.org) is still open, as of the date of this post. If you are doing something exciting with Ruby and/or Rails, please submit a proposal. Thanks.
