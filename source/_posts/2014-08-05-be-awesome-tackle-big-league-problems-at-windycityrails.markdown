Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?

* You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you're "done", you know you can make it better, but you're not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.

* You recently graduated from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com), [Starter League](http://thestarterleague.com), or another school. You’re ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.

* You are no longer a beginner. You have seen _advanced_ developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.

* Software development is relatively new to you, but you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can start something useful.

Common thread for all of the above: Awesomeness is in your bones, and you are ready to unleash it. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you’re ready to tackle _Big League Problems_. [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) is for you.
