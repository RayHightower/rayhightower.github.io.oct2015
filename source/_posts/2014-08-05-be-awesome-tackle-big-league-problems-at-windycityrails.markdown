Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?

* You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you're "done", you know you can make it better, but you're not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.

* You recently graduated from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com), [Starter League](http://thestarterleague.com), or another school. You're ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.

* You are no longer a beginner. You have seen _advanced_ developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.

* Software development is relatively new to you, but you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can start something useful.

Common thread: It's time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle _Big League Problems_. [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) is for you.

###What are Big League Problems?
You might think of a big league problem as a good problem. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you're bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would want to buy from you? How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecure, choose a new platform, or some combination of the above? [Dr. Nic Williams](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#williams), [Brian Shirai](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#shirai), [Evan Light](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#light), [Mark Menard](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#menard) have dealt with problems just like that. Learn from them.

Maybe you built a gem to solve a problem for yourself, and now you want to release your gem to the world. What legal questions do you need to consider? [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://twitter.com/dhh) faced a similar challenge when he built Rails, right? [Daliah Saper](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#saper) is an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and other aspects of open source. Put her team to work for you.

How about security? Have you outgrown the `Devise` gem? Or do you simply need to know more about `Devise` internals so that you can use it more effectively? Maybe it's time to abandon username/password logins altogether and go with SQRL. [Justin Love](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#love) and [Lucas Mazza](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#mazza) might have some ideas in this area.
