What can we build with disposable electronics? An ad in the January 2014 issue of [Wired Magazine](http://wired.com) lets the reader change the color of a Moto X smartphone by pressing a colored circle on the page. This 20-second video shows the ad in operation followed by a glimpse of the inner workings.

###Inner Workings
Taking the ad apart required one simple tool, a pair of scissors. Here's what's inside:

* Eleven switches in one switch assembly. The switches are connected to the circuit board via seven leads.
* Three LEDs, pointed to shine light on a 3.5" x 6.5" reflecting panel.

###Advantages
The ad is different. It captured my attention enough to make me want to blog about it!

###Disadvantage
Something I hate to admit: I played with this paper gadget for a good ten minutes and I took the thing apart _before_ I considered reading the ad copy. Maybe the color change is too distracting for the ad to be effective? 

Or maybe the
