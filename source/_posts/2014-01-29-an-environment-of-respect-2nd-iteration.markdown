Preface

WindyCityRails is and has been an event made up of welcoming, tolerant, compassionate, and loving participants. For several years now, WindyCityRails participants have been respectful of one another in our differences. We have employed those differences to elevate, educate, and celebrate one another at WindyCityRails.

It is in that same spirit that we now adopt this Code of Conduct: Not as a punitive action, but as a measure to protect that which we already have and to signal to all that we are a tolerant and loving community.

WindyCityRails Code of Conduct

WindyCityRails is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. WindyCityRails participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the event organizers' discretion. This applies to all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and otherwise.

That said, silliness, mockery, and general irreverence are welcome, expected, and even encouraged so long as they all come from a loving place.

However, should another participant's behavior be injurious to you, we ask three things.

1) Give others the benefit of the doubt.

People are generally decent. It has been our experience, these past several years, that those who attend WindyCityRails are just a cut above in that respect.

2) Attempt to address the behavior with the other party immediately.

In the case of intractable situations, we are here to help you (see "Ask for Help!" below). However, this is where we ask participants to try to behave "like grown ups." It is part of the WindyCityRails ethos: If you have a problem with something, don't wait for someone to fix it but instead try to fix it yourself.

If you’re comfortable doing so, let the person know that you found what he or she said or did inappropriate. Attempt to resolve the situation amicably. When addressing it yourself, remember to continue to treat the other party with kindness and respect.

If you're uncomfortable approaching the other person…

3) Ask for Help!

We're all human. While life, and WindyCityRails, expects a good deal of self-sufficiency, we are also a community. If you cannot manage a situation alone, we are here for you. Seek out any member of the conference organizer team. We can be identified with special "Organizer" lanyards.
