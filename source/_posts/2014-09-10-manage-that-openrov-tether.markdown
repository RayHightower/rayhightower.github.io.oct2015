Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my OpenROV before I built a good tether management system. Oh what chaos ensues when we pilot without a management system! Bottom line: Have a tether management plan, any plan, before you pilot your OpenROV.

This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have plans that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that works for you.

###Slip Ring
The slip ring is central to this tether management solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to turn while important electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for about $18.00.

###Tether Spool
It is possible to construct a spool from scratch using acrylic or some other material. This design is based on an existing spool, modified to suit the OpenROV tether.

[Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/) sells an electrical cord reel that fits the bill. Cost: About $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and youâ€™re good to go.
