Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my OpenROV before I built a good tether management system. Bad idea! It's much better to have a tether management plan, any plan, before you pilot your OpenROV.

This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have plans that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that works for you.

###The Tether Management Device

This tether management system is constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts. The main componenet is an extension cord reel sold by [Home Depot](http://homedepot.com) for about $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and youâ€™re good to go.

###Slip Ring

The slip ring is central to this tether management solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to turn while important electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for about $18.00.

###Everything Fits

The new tether management system is small enough to share space with an OpenROV in a [Nanuk 935 case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BP8UNFS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), available from Amazon. The case is small enough to fly as an airline carry-on.

And when it's time to explore, whip everything out and you're ready to go.
