Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my OpenROV before I built a good tether management system. Bad idea! It's better to have a tether management plan (any plan) before you pilot your OpenROV.

This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have plans that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that works for you.

###The Tether Management Device
This tether management system is constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts. The main component is an extension cord reel sold by [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/p/KAB-Enterprise-Co-Ltd-20-ft-16-3-Cord-Reel-with-4-Outlets-CR002/100661463?MERCH=RV-_-RV_homepage_rr-1-_-NA-_-100661463-_-N) for about $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and youâ€™re good to go.

###Slip Ring

The slip ring is central to this solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to spin while electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/736?gclid=CJDMiPma1cACFQoEaQod1iwAFQ) for about $18.00.

###Everything Fits
The new tether management system is small enough to share space with an OpenROV inside a [Nanuk 935 case](http://nanukcase.com/productdetails.asp?node=205). The Nanuk case is rugged and small enough to fly as an airline carry-on.

And when it's time to explore, whip everything out and you're ready to explore.
