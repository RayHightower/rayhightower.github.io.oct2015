[OpenROV is an underwater robot](/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) controlled through a web browser. The server-side of the web app is written in Node.js, and it runs on a BeagleBone Black inside the OpenROV. 

You don't need to know Node.js on order to use pilot an OpenROV. And you don't need to do anything in this article to make your OpenROV work. But if you’re the kind of maker who likes to dig deep into a project, you might want to explore Node.js.

###Mac OS X and Node.js
Everything written here applies to Node.js as it runs on Mac OS X. If your local machine runs Linux or Windows, you will need to consult other resources in order to get Node up and running.

###Homebrew First
Make sure you’re running Homebrew on your Mac. Homebrew is a very seamless way to manage packages on Mac OS X. To install Homebrew…

```bash



```

To confirm that Homebrew is running properly…


```bash
$ brew doctor

```



###Installing Node.js
Now that Homebrew is installed and running.




###Next Steps
Future discussions about Node.js and  OpenROV will consider the following questions.


   * What does Node.js do for OpenROV that other languages can’t do?

   * What other languages might we use to control OpenROV? It’s all open source, so our brainstorms could one day turn into actual code!


Keep exploring!
