The current team of [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) organizers assumed leadership in August 2007. About five people would attend the monthly meetings, and the group's [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/chicagoruby) database contained 78 members. The previous organizer was swamped with work (always a good thing) so he handed the baton to a new crew.

Today, the _new crew_ has grown ChicagoRuby to over 2,700 members. The group hosts three meetups every month, and the downtown meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. Bonus: ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) in Chicago and [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) on the Caribbean island of Barbados.

How did ChicagoRuby do it? Through teamwork, iteration, and learning from mistakes.

###First: Get a Good Name
Our first priority upon assuming leadership: Growth. In order to grow, a group has to attract new members. New members who are looking for groups to join are likely to start with the search engines, and search engines like simplicity.

The group was originally called _The Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group_. Accurate, and a mouthful. We discovered that the [ChicagoRuby.org](http://chicagoruby.org) name was available, so we grabbed it, along with the [@ChicagoRuby](http://twitter.com/chicagoruby) Twitter handle.

It was also important to make every web property point to all of the other web properties in the ChicagoRuby ecosystem. For example, all of the conference pages point to the ChicagoRuby main page, and vice versa.

###Keep Monthly Events Free
I firmly believe that monthly meetings should be free.  We never know what a member of our community is going through financially. Therefore, nobody will be barred from a monthly ChicagoRuby meeting for lack of money.

My personal history includes times when I was dead broke due to one “entrepreneurial” venture or another. So I have emotional reasons for keeping ChicagoRuby’s monthly events free of charge.

Of course, the money to pay for the meetings has to come from somewhere. That’s where sponsors come in.

###Cover Costs Through Sponsorships
Sponsorships don’t always have to come in the form of money. ChicagoRuby’s first sponsor was [DeForest Group](http://www.deforestgroup.com/) in Elmhurst, IL. Owner [Lee DeForest](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leedeforest) provides ChicagoRuby with free space and WiFi for our Saturday events. Lee was one of the five people in the room when the current organizers took over, and we will always be grateful to him for supporting us in the early days.

ChicagoRuby’s downtown sponsors are [Enova](http://enova.com) and [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com). Each company provides space, WiFi, pizza, and beverages on a monthly basis. 

Sponsors get involved with user groups for two main reasons: To recruit developers, or to market products to developers. Everybody wins when sponsors get involved with user groups, financially or otherwise.
