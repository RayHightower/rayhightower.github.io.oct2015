The current team of [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) organizers assumed leadership in August 2007. About five people would attend the monthly meetings, and the group's Meetup.com database had 78 members. The previous organizer was swamped with work (always a good thing) so he handed the baton to a new crew.

Today, the _new crew_ has grown ChicagoRuby to over 2,700 members. Monthly meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. And ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) in Chicago and [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) on the Caribbean island of Barbados.

How did ChicagoRuby do it? Primarily, by learning from our mistakes.
