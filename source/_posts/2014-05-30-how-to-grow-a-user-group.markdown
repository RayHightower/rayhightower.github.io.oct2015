The current team of [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) organizers assumed leadership in August 2007. About five people would attend the monthly meetings, and the group's [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/chicagoruby) database contained 78 members. The previous organizer was swamped with work (always a good thing) so he handed the baton to a new crew.

Today, the _new crew_ has grown ChicagoRuby to over 2,700 members. The group hosts three meetups every month, and the downtown meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. Bonus: ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) in Chicago and [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) on the Caribbean island of Barbados.

How did ChicagoRuby do it? Through teamwork, iteration, and learning from mistakes.

###First: Build a Team
ChicagoRuby will always have multiple organizers. The group is stronger with multiple brains at the helm. We started with three organizers in August 2007. Today we have eight. Working as a team enables us to build on each other’s strengths: Some organizers have strong design skills, others are strong developers. And some are good at asking members for help with user group tasks.

###How to Ask for Help

>Any favor he asks of you, you will offer to do before he requests it.
> <br/>~Tom Hagen, Consigliere

One way to ask for help: Encourage members to help in their area of enthusiasm. For example, organizer [Ginny Hendry](https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry) runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights every month. Ginny got started when she approached me after one meeting and said “We should have hack nights.” Clearly, she was enthused about hack nights, so I asked her to run them for the group. 

Today, Ginny’s hack nights are consistently the highest rated of all ChicagoRuby events. Members who have ideas for improvement tend to be strong leaders. When we get out of their way and let them lead, the whole group benefits. 

The [ChicagoRuby Organizer Page](http://www.chicagoruby.org/about/organizers/) contains the list of current and past organizers. Each has helped to make the group stronger.

###Naming the Group
Growth is an ongoing priority for ChicagoRuby. In order to grow, a group has to attract new members. New members who are looking for a group to join are likely to start with a search engine, and search engines crave simplicity.

Our group was originally called _The Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group_. Accurate, and a mouthful. We discovered that a simple domain name, [ChicagoRuby.org](http://chicagoruby.org), name was available. So we grabbed it, along with the [@ChicagoRuby](http://twitter.com/chicagoruby) Twitter handle.

It is also important to make every web property point to all of the other web properties in the ChicagoRuby ecosystem. For example, all of the conference sites point to the ChicagoRuby site, and vice versa. A new member who finds one part of the ecosystem will find the whole thing. People feel welcome when they know everything that the group has to offer.

Making future members feel welcome is key to growth. Free meetings are another way to make people feel welcome. 

###Keep Monthly Events Free
I firmly believe that monthly user group meetings should be free. We never know what a member of our community is going through financially. Therefore, nobody will be barred from a monthly ChicagoRuby meeting for lack of money.

My personal history includes times when I was dead broke due to one entrepreneurial venture or another. So I have emotional reasons for keeping ChicagoRuby’s monthly events free of charge.

Of course, the money to pay for the meetings has to come from somewhere. That’s where sponsors come in.

###Cover Monthly Costs Through Sponsorships
Companies will gladly sponsor a group that gives them a return on their investment. Sponsorships don’t always have to come in the form of money.

For example, ChicagoRuby’s first sponsor was [DeForest Group](http://www.deforestgroup.com/). Owner [Lee DeForest](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leedeforest) provides ChicagoRuby with free space and WiFi for our Saturday meetings. Lee was one of the five people in the room when the current organizers took over, and we will always be grateful to him for supporting us in the early days.

ChicagoRuby’s downtown sponsors are [Enova](http://enova.com) and [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com). Each company provides space, WiFi, pizza, and beverages on a monthly basis. 

All of our sponsors have the opportunity to address our group at the beginning of the meeting. More important, by sponsoring ChicagoRuby over time, the company build trust amongst the membership.

Sponsors get involved with user groups for two main reasons: To recruit developers, or to market products to developers. Everybody wins when sponsors get involved with user groups, financially or otherwise.

###Maintaining Focus
Over the years, ChicagoRuby has experimented with other ventures. We ran a job board for awhile. We ran conferences related to NoSQL and mobile. We moved away from these because they drained our resources, and pulled us away from our core, which is Ruby. We continue to believe in polyglot programming, and the [polyglot night](http://www.chicagoruby.org/videos/archives/2013/12/03/ployglot-night/) in Jan 2014 was very successful. You can expect to see another polyglot night in the future.

###Learning from Mistakes
Members have come to trust the ChicagoRuby organizers over the years. 


###The Future: RubyCaribe and LinuxBarbados
Our newest work is happenging in the Caribbean, in the island nation of Barbados. [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) and [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org).

With LinuxBarbadfos, we hope to follow the model that has worked well for us here in the States. Keep the user group (LinuxBarbados) free by charging for the conference (RubyCaribe). Collaborating with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill gives the group a huge advantage. 

Dr. Colin Depradine, Dean of the University’s Faculty of Science and Technology is serious about growing the next generation of scientists and engineers in the Caribbean.
