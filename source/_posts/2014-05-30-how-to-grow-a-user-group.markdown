[ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) started as a small user group in the Chicago’s Western suburbs. Five people attended the August 2007 meeting where the current organizers assumed leadership. The Meetup.com membership list contained 78 members at that time.

Today, ChicagoRuby’s Meetup membership is 2,700+. Monthly meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. And ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) in Chicago and [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) in Barbados.

How did ChicagoRuby do it? Through iteration, trail, error, recovery,
and continuous learning. We're not done yet. If you have ideas for
improvement, feel free to post your thoughts in the comments section
