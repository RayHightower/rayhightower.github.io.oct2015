[Ninefold](https://ninefold.com/) is Rails hosting platform based in Australia. Although the company is new, the team is backed by the 20-year-old [Maquarie Telcom](http://www.macquarietelecom.com/).

I first met the Ninefold team at RailsConf 2014 in Chicago. I'm in San Francisco this week for RubyMotion #Inspect and related events, so I took the time to stop by their San Francisco office. Now it's time to take the service for a spin.

These experiments were conducted with Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4.1.1. Destructive testing has always been my best instructor, so I used [RVM](/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/) to create a special gemset for Ninefold experiments.

```bash

$ rvm current
ruby-2.1.1@ninefold

$

```

The sandbox is ready. Let the games begin.
