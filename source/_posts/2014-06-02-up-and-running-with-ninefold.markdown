[Ninefold](https://ninefold.com/) is an Australia-based Rails hosting platform. Although the company is new, the team is backed by the 20-year-old Maquarie Telcom.

These experiments were conducted with Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4.1.1. Destructive testing has always been my best instructor, so I used [RVM](/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/) to create a special gemset for Ninefold experiments.

```bash

$ rvm current
ruby-2.1.1@ninefold

$

```
