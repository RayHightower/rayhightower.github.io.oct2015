A brand new 16-processor Parallella computer arrived at WisdomGroup this weekend. The devices are in demand and supplies are short. We waited over a year for this one. As of this writing the devices are sold out again!

Why is there so much demand for a 16-core parallel computer? Is it the price ($119.00), the performance, or the novelty?
