A brand new 18-core (16-core [FPGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) plus 2-core ARM) Parallella computer arrived at WisdomGroup this weekend. The devices are in demand and supplies are short. We waited over a year for this one. As of this writing the devices are sold out again!

Why is there so much demand for a tiny parallel computer? Is it the price ($119.00), the performance, or the novelty?
