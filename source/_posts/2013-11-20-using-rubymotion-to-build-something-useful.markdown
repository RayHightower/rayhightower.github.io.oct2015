The Chicago RubyMotion User Group held its inaugural meeting last night.
The organizer, Dave Astels, asked me to present. Thanks Dave for the
opportunity to share my experiences with the group.

Fellow developers are welcome to examine the [code examples on GitHub](https://github.com/RayHightower/Chicago-RubyMotion-Nov2013).

The first few minutes were spent in [intro/overview mode](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/).
