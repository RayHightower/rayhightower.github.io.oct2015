[Flourish](http://flourishconf.com) is an open source conference held at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Saturday, April 5, 2014. The conference is run by university students and tickets are free.

Thank you, Flourish organizers, for inviting me to speak this year. UIC is where I first learned about Linux and the web, so the University is special to me.

Why go to Flourish?
<!—more—>
* You like open source.
* You want to know more about open source.
* You want to meet people who are passionate about open source.
* All (or some combination) of the above.

###Not Just Software
Linux may be the best known open source product, but open source is not just about software. At Flourish 2009 a presenter mentioned a funny little circuit board called “Arduino” during one of the presentations. I turned to my neighbor in the audience, and I asked “What’s an Arduino?”

My neighbor pulled one out of his backpack. Wow. Open source extends to hardware, too! Since then, [Raspeberry Pi], [Beaglebone Black](), and [Parallella]() have joined the open source hardware ranks.

###See You There
Great things happen when like-minded people come together to exchange ideas. I look forward to seeing you at Flourish 2014!
