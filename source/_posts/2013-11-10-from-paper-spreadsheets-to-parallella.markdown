The [Raspberry Pi](/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/), Beaglebone Black, and Parallella are powerful and small. But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.

###Inspiration
The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my _regular work_ faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent that time with the HP 5036.

My first exposure to assembler language came through an HP 5036
Microprocessor Lab. The lab was designed for electical engineers who
wanted to learn about microprocessors long after graduating from
college. The lab was designed for engineers who finished college before
the advent of the microprocessor.
