The [New York City Node JS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/206159562) invited me to speak about [OpenROV](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) Wednesday evening. I am grateful to [Shutterstock](http://shutterstock.com), [Matt Walters](https://twitter.com/mateodelnorte) and the other organizers for making it happen. Slides from the presentation appear below.
