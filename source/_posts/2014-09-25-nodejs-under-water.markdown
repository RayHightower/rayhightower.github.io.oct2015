The [New York City Node JS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/206159562) asked me to speak about [OpenROV](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) Wednesday evening. About fifty developers came out for the meeting. Thank you [Shutterstock](http://shutterstock.com), [Matt Walters](https://twitter.com/mateodelnorte) and the other Node JS organizers for making it happen. Slides from the presentation appear below.

###Presentation Video
The following video is a rough draft, useful if you want to hear the dialog that went along with the slides. The question & answer period may also be interesting. The official video is scheduled for release next week.

Our work with OpenROV will climax at [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) in January 2015. If you're an intermediate or advanced Ruby developer, and if you're interested in other languages (like Node.js) then RubyCaribe might be for you.
