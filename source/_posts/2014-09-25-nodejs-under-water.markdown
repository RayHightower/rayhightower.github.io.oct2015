The [New York City Node JS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/206159562) asked me to speak about [OpenROV](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) Wednesday evening. About fifty developers came out for the meeting. Thank you [Shutterstock](http://shutterstock.com), [Matt Walters](https://twitter.com/mateodelnorte), and all of the organizers for making it happen. Slides appear below.

###Presentation Video
The following video is a rough draft, useful if you want to hear the dialog that went along with the slides. Lots of good questions from the audience. The official video is scheduled for release next week.

Our work with OpenROV will climax at [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com) in January 2015. If you're an intermediate or advanced Ruby developer, and if you're interested in other languages (like Node.js) then RubyCaribe might be for you.
