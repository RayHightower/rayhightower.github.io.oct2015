The Chicago chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) hosted a lecture titled _Supercomputing and You_ yesterday evening. The talk was delivered by [Sharan Kalwani](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharankalwani) of Fermilab. Kalwani's background blends mechanical engineering and computer science with hands-on experience in automotive engineering, supercomputing, hardware driver design, and (buzzword alert) big data. 

###What is High Performance Computing?
10x the state of the art

###Cray in 1972
Seymour Cray cobbled together the first supercomputer using off-the-shelf components of the day and his unique ideas about computer architecture. 

1-foot cables so no component is more than one nanosecond from its source signal. Electronic signals travel at the speed of light. In one billionth if a second, a signal can travel about xx feet. Cray decided that his new design would have no internal signal cars longer than xxx feet so no component is more than one nanosecond from its source signal.
 
###Top500
Not every supercomputer in the world is on this list. Some governments or companies don't want to make their strengths public. 

###Other Top Lists
High performance computers use a lot of power. Rule of thumb: 1MW of electricity used for one year costs $1 million. The owners of the #1on the Top 500 list spend $17 million dollars per year just on electricity.

So other measuring sticks are used to determine the "best " HPC.  For example:

Green 100

###Beyond Moore's Law


###So What?
Why do we need to spend time and money on high performance computers? What are they used for? Is it really important to get more realism in first person shooter games?
