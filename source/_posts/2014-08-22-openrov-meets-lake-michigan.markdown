###Success: OpenROV and Lake Michigan
{% imgcap middle /images/openrov_chicago_lake_michigan.jpg OpenROV and Lake Michigan. %}

Wednesday afternoon I took the OpenROV for a spin in Chicagoâ€™s Lake Michigan. Success! Here are a few things I noticed during this first voyage:

* The electronics chassis is truly waterproof! Same for the battery compartments. Waterproofing was my biggest concern during assembly. Hats off to the OpenROV team for an excellent set of assembly instructions.
* Condensation builds up in the electronics chassis during operation. A quick review of the OpenROV forum tells me that I should add a desiccant bag to the compartment. Or pack the unit in low humidity.
* The OpenROV is a little back-heavy. The back dips lower than the front during operation. I should add some weights to the front of the unit.
* Tether management is a _must_. After one voyage (can you really call a
simple dip in the lake a voyage?) my OpenROV tether is a mess. Time to
build a way to manage the tether.

What an exciting way to learn about Node.js, BeagleBone Black, and the Maker Movement all at once.
