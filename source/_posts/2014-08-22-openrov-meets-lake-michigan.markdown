###Success: OpenROV and Lake Michigan
Yesterday afternoon I took the OpenROV for a spin in Chicagoâ€™s Lake Michigan. Success! Here are a few things I noticed during this first voyage:

* Condensation builds up in the electronics compartment. I should add a desiccant bag to the compartment. Or pack the unit in low humidity.
* The OpenROV is a little back-heavy. I should add some weights to the front of the unit.

What an exciting way to learn about Node.js, BeagleBone Black, and the Maker Movement all at once!
