After the completion of this year's [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org), there was time to relax this weekend. What better way to relax than to experiment with solar energy and Parallella!

This article covers a simple hardware hack: Making the Parallella run on solar energy. 

Motivation: The fastest computers in the world gulp electricity at an alarming rate. For example, [Tianhe-2](http://www.top500.org/system/177999) at the National Super Computer Center in Guangzhou, China uses 17.8 megawatts of energy per year. In dollars, that’s roughly $17 million spent on electricity spent each year, depending on how the electricity is sourced.

Scientists at [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov/) estimate that the earth's surface absorbs enough solar energy in ninety minutes to power every electrical device on the planet for a full year. A year's worth of energy in ninety minutes! Surely we can use some of that energy to power our supercomputers.

###Simple Photovoltaic Cell



###It works!
It probably doesn’t make sense to call this a project. It’s more of a proof of concept. Scaling up will cost money and time. But the ROI is certainly worth it.
