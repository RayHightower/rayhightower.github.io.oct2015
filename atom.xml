<a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> #1227 went for a spin in Lake Michigan this week. Success! Here are a few first-voyage observations:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The electronics chassis is truly waterproof. Same for the battery compartments. Waterproofing was my biggest concern during assembly. Hats off to the OpenROV team for an excellent set of assembly instructions.</li>
<li>Condensation builds up in the electronics chassis during operation. A quick review of the OpenROV forum tells me that I should add a desiccant bag to the compartment. Or pack the unit in low humidity.</li>
<li>The OpenROV is a little back-heavy. The back dips lower than the front during operation. I should add some weights to the front of the unit.</li>
<li>Tether management is a <em>must</em>. After one voyage (can you really call a
simple dip in the lake a voyage?) my OpenROV tether is a mess. Time to
build a way to manage the tether.</li>
</ul>


<p>What an exciting way to explore Node.js, BeagleBone Black, and the Maker Movement all at once.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_esc.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.' title='Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.'><span class='caption-text'>Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.</span></span></p>

<h3>ESCs: New Experience for Me</h3>

<p>Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) were completely new to me when I first assembled my <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a>. This article documents my initial misunderstanding (and eventual understanding) of ESCs so that future builders can move forward with fewer glitches.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The photo at the top of this page shows an OpenROV controller board, a
BeagleBone Black, and three ESCs. This article will focus on the ESCs.</p>

<h3>Remember This About ESCs</h3>

<p>Until all three ESCs are programmed <em>and</em> calibrated, the OpenROV might behave erratically. For example&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>The servo that moves the camera up and down will not respond to keyboard commands.</li>
<li>When you turn one ESC switch on, an unrelated motor (or motors, plural) might start spinning. In my case, turning on one ESC (any of the three ESCs) caused two motors to spin.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my case, the programming was correct, but I <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/19/openrov-assembly-challenges/">dropped the ball on calibration</a>. And when the motors responded out-of-sync with the switches, I thought I had soldered some connections incorrectly. De-soldering and re-soldering connections would have been a ton of extra work, and that would not have solved the problem.</p>

<p>I reached out to the <a href="http://openrov.com/forum">forum</a> where OpenROV engineer Brian Adams pointed me in the right direction. Brian&rsquo;s diplomatic response could be summarized as <em>RTFM</em>. So I re-RTFM&rsquo;d, and it worked!</p>

<p>The bottom line: Do the ESC programming and calibration first. If the OpenROV misbehaves, re-check programming and calibration before considering other solutions.</p>

<h3>Why Use ESCs?</h3>

<p>Since ESCs require so many steps (programming and calibration) we might logically ask: <em>Why use ESCs at all?</em> Why not use simple analog motors without controllers and call it a day?</p>

<p>We use ESCs because the benefits outweigh the work required to configure them. It&rsquo;s all about control. By using an ESC to control each motor, we can use software to specify the <em>exact</em> number of RPMs and direction for each motor. We can make any motor (or combination or motors) start, stop, or change direction on a dime. Even better: When we move a lever on our controller of choice (keyboard, game controller, etc.) software on the OpenROV controller board decides the exact number of RPMs for each motor at that instant. OpenROV pilots don&rsquo;t need to think about this process while it happens. It just works.</p>

<p>The pilot&rsquo;s finger moves a controller lever. The lever position gets sent to software on the OpenROV controller board, and the controller board tells each ESC what its corresponding motor should do.</p>

<p>In summary, we use ESCs so that OpenROV pilots can have greater control over movement.</p>

<h3>How to Re-Check ESC Programming</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC program card.' title='ESC program card.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC program card.</span></span>
Those of you with ESC experience already know about ESC program cards. I first learned about the cards while researching this problem. Amazing devices! Yes, it is possible to program ESCs using the series of button pushes and beeps in the OpenROV instructions. That&rsquo;s what I did, and it works. But a program card is faster. Amazon sells ESC program cards for less than fifteen dollars each. Well worth the investment, especially if you&rsquo;re programming ESCs for several OpenROVs.</p>

<h3>ESC Calibration Gotcha</h3>

<p>ESC calibration was tricky for me because turning on any of the three ESC switches caused two of my motors to spin: vertical and port. Further, since my electronics chassis was (mostly) assembled by the time I got to the calibration step, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to trace each power switch to its corresponding ESC.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I had to do.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_esc_switch_labels.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC switch labels.' title='ESC switch labels.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC switch labels.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>First, I took everything apart, while keeping the electronic leads (those which had already been soldered) intact. I needed to do this so I could see where each wire was going.</li>
<li>Next, I labeled the back of each ESC switch with its corresponding ESC number. I did not want to go through the disassembly step again! The Brother P-Touch label maker was perfect for this step.</li>
<li>Finally, I followed the ESC calibration steps <em>while ignoring the behavior of the motors</em>. For example, turning on ESC1 caused the motors connected to ESC1 (port) <em>and</em> ESC2 (vertical) to spin. I ignored the motors while plowing through OpenROV&rsquo;s written calibration steps.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modified Calibration Steps</h3>

<p>Here are the OpenROV calibration steps, with slight tweaks based on my personal experience.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_calibration_sliders.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Click "Diagnostics" from the OpenROV cockpit.' title='Click "Diagnostics" from the OpenROV cockpit.'><span class='caption-text'>Click &ldquo;Diagnostics&rdquo; from the OpenROV cockpit.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Each ESC switch has a red reset button. To turn the ESC on, move its slider switch toward the red reset button. The off position is in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>With all of the ESCs switched off, go ahead and power up the OpenROV. The motors should remain stationary at this point. Connect with the cockpit software and open the diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>Grab one ESC switch, and hold down its red reset button while powering it on. (At this point, two of my motors began spinning, V and P. I ignored the spinning motors while plowing through the rest of the steps.) You will hear a beeping noise. Let go of the reset button. (It will keep beeping which is fine). While it’s beeping, the red LED inside the corresponding ESC will flash in rhythm with the beeps.</li>
<li>Press reset once and you should hear a single beep. Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the right (or click the &ldquo;1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You should get 2 beeps. The motor will not move during this step.</li>
<li>Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the left (or click the &ldquo;-1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You will hear three beeps.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the motor will begin to spin. Switch off the ESC, and the motor will stop spinning.</li>
<li>Move the slider back to the middle (or click the &ldquo;0&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Repeat these steps with the next ESC until all three ESCs are done.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_lake_michigan_2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.' title='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.</span></span>
After calibration:</p>

<ul>
<li>With all three ESCs powered on, the motors remained stationary, as expected.</li>
<li>Each motor responded to the correct slider within the cockpit software&rsquo;s diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>The up/down servo for the camera responded correctly to the Q, A, and Z commands.</li>
<li>The motors responded to keyboard commands, as described within the cockpit&rsquo;s quick reference guide.</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, calibration worked when I ignored the behavior of the motors while plowing through the steps.</p>

<h3>Success</h3>

<p>There is great satisfaction in solving an elusive problem. The OpenROV forum proved to be a powerful and useful resource. Next step: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/22/openrov-meets-chicago-lake-michigan/">Piloting the OpenROV in Lake Michigan</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_rth.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV fully assembled.' title='OpenROV fully assembled.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV fully assembled.</span></span>
I know this problem can be solved. I just haven’t figured it out yet, and I need help from the <a href="http://openrov.com/">OpenROV</a> community to do so.</p>

<p><em>Update: The OpenROV community delivered. Solution: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov/">ESC Programming and Calibration for OpenROV</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Parts That Work</h3>

<p>Software image updates on the Beaglebone Black work flawlessly thanks to scripts written by <a href="https://github.com/BrianAdams">Brian Adams</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codewithpassion">Dominick Fretz</a>. The cockpit software shows a real-time image from the camera, the LED lights are super-bright, and the lasers hold steady at 10cm apart. My fully assembled OpenROV passes the water submersion test. Yes, it’s waterproof, thanks to O-rings and silicon-based lubricant!</p>

<p>What about the motors? The motors work, almost. Could it be the
electronic speed control (ESC) settings, calibration, or less than
perfect soldering? That&rsquo;s where I need help.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Summary of Symptoms</h3>

<p>With the cockpit software running and attached to the OpenROV:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I turn on any of the three ESCs, two of the motors (vertical and port) start running at full blast. The starboard motor remains stationary.</li>
<li>While the V and P motors continue to run at full blast, the starboard motor responds to the cockpit slider controls as expected: +1 makes S run full blast on one direction, -1 sends S full blast in the other direction, and 0 stops the S motor completely. During this exercise, V and P continue at full blast.</li>
<li>Turning off the ESC stops the V and P motors.</li>
<li>When I turn on any of the ESCs, the camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees. And then the V and P motors run full blast.</li>
</ul>


<p>When the cockpit software is not running (and the Google Chrome browser is completely closed):</p>

<ul>
<li>Turning on an ESC has no effect on the motors.</li>
<li>The camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees, as it did with the cockpit software running. But the motors remain stationary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Interesting behavior!</p>

<h3>Double-Checking the ESC Settings</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC Program Card' title='ESC Program Card'><span class='caption-text'>ESC Program Card</span></span>
During troubleshooting, my first step was to double-check the electronic speed controller (ESC) settings. Setting the ESCs with the beep-and-button-push method was time consuming. And I was concerned that I may have made a mistake in counting the beeps.</p>

<p>Solution: I bought an ESC program card. Amazon sells them for less than fifteen dollars, well worth the price when you consider the peace of mind that the card brings. The program card shows each ESC setting with a clear 7-segment LED display, much easier than counting beeps!</p>

<p>According to the program card, all of the ESC settings are correct.</p>

<h3>Using a Power Supply Instead of Batteries</h3>

<p>All of the time spent troubleshooting drained the OpenROV batteries. So I devised a way to apply power directly to the OpenROV without batteries.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_power_supply.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Directly connected to power supply.' title='Directly connected to power supply.'><span class='caption-text'>Directly connected to power supply.</span></span></p>

<p>The photo reveals the random condition of my work surface, so here&rsquo;s a verbal description of this hack:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the background, a power supply set to 12 volts</li>
<li><code>+</code> lead (red) connected to the <code>+</code> leads of the battery containers, via a wire acting as a Y-connector.</li>
<li><code>-</code> lead (black) connected to a ground terminal on the OpenROV controller board through a black jumper cable</li>
</ul>


<p>I find that this hack works best if I connect the 12 volt setup first while the Topside Adapter is powered off. Applying power (via USB) to the Topside Adapter turns the entire assembly on.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this section and you know a better way for me to connect the power supply, please advise in the comments section below.</p>

<h3>Advice Welcome</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to look next to solve the challenge with the motors. Maybe I skipped a step somewhere during assembly? Advice welcome!</p>

<p><em>Update: As noted at the beginning of this article, this problem has been solved. Solution: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov/">ESC Programming and Calibration for OpenROV</a>.</em></p>

Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you&rsquo;re &ldquo;done&rdquo;, you know you can make it better, but you&rsquo;re not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.</p></li>
<li><p>You recently graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://thestarterleague.com">Starter League</a>, <a href="http://www.mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers</a> or another school. You&rsquo;re ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.</p></li>
<li><p>You are no longer a beginner. You have seen <em>advanced</em> developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Software development is relatively new to you, and you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can launch something useful.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Common thread: It&rsquo;s time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle <em>Big League Problems</em>. <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> is for you.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What are Big League Problems?</h3>

<p>You might think of a big league problem as a good problem. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you&rsquo;re bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would buy from you?</p>

<p>Now&hellip; How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecture, choose a new platform, or some combination of these? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#williams">Dr. Nic Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#shirai">Brian Shirai</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#light">Evan Light</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#menard">Mark Menard</a> deal with scaling problems. Learn from them.</p>

<p>Maybe you built a gem to solve a problem for yourself, and now you want to release your gem to the world. What legal questions do you need to consider? Did Rails face similar challenges in the beginning? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#saper">Daliah Saper</a> is an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and other open source software issues. Put her team to work for you.</p>

<p>How about security? Have you outgrown the <code>Devise</code> gem? Or do you simply need to know more about <code>Devise</code> internals so that you can use it more effectively? Maybe it&rsquo;s time to abandon username/password logins altogether and go with SQRL. <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#love">Justin Love</a> and <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#mazza">Lucas Mazza</a> might have some ideas for you.</p>

<h3>Awesome Speakers. Awesome Audience.</h3>

<p>This year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails features the most powerful collection of speakers we&rsquo;ve ever assembled. Check out the <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/">complete list of WindyCityRails speakers</a> and ask yourself what you can learn from each one.</p>

<p>Even better: Only 300 WindyCityRails tickets will be sold. Our speakers enjoy interacting with audience members throughout the conference. As professionals, they are always learning, too! So if you want some face time with people who understand Big League Problems (and more importantly, Big League Solutions) WindyCityRails is the place for you to be.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a> is an effective way to manage Ruby versions on Linux or OS X. RVM was working well on my Ubuntu-based <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">Parallella</a>, until one day it stopped:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt; rvm list
</span><span class='line'>rvm: Command not found.
</span><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>rvm: Command not found.</code> Fortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/theotherzach">Zach Briggs</a> and I were pairing at a joint OpenHack &ndash; ChicagoRuby event when the problem occurred. Zach is an ideal pairing partner; troubleshooting was smooth because he was there. Time to investigate.</p>

<h3>Explicit Path</h3>

<p>After a few experiments, we discovered that we could run RVM by explicitly specifying the path to the executable:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt; ~/.rvm/bin/rvm list
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rvm rubies
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>   ruby-2.0.0-p481 <span class="o">[</span> armv7l <span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Default ruby not set. Try &#39;rvm alias create default &lt;ruby&gt;&#39;.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># =&gt; - current</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># =* - current &amp;&amp; default</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#  * - default</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Therefore, it appeared that the Ubuntu/Linux <code>$PATH</code> variable was being ignored. Google led us to consider the shell in use on the Parallella.</p>

<h3>Which Shell Is In Use?</h3>

<p>The shell is just a program that lets humans talk to the Linux operating system through a command line interface. Several shell programs exist. Linux users tend to prefer one shell or another. The <code>$SHELL</code> environmental variable points to the one in use.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt; <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span>
</span><span class='line'>/bin/tcsh
</span><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Very interesting. <code>tcsh</code> was the current Parallella shell. I&rsquo;m more accustomed to <code>bash</code>. Could RVM prefer <code>bash</code> too? We changed one line of <code>/etc/passwd</code> to tell the Parallella to start with <code>bash</code> instead of <code>tcsh</code> and rebooted the Parallella.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt; <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span>
</span><span class='line'>/bin/bash
</span><span class='line'>linaro-nano:~&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&hellip;and now RVM works normally.</p>

<h3>Consider Fish?</h3>

<p>Right after this exercise, Zach and <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_cheek">Josh Cheek</a> had a Twitter conversation about a shell called <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish</a>. Something new and shiny to explore!</p>

<h3>Original Plan: Rubinius</h3>

<p>Did I mention that we originally planned to install <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/06/installing-rubinius-using-rvm/">Rubinius</a> on the Parallella? Where there are goals, there are yaks waiting to be shaved!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_screenshot.png' width='' height='' alt='Parallella screenshot, 1080p.' title='Parallella screenshot, 1080p.'><span class='caption-text'>Parallella screenshot, 1080p.</span></span>
Parallella is a single-board supercomputer smaller than a deck of cards. While today’s fastest laptops contain four processor cores, Parallella has <em>eighteen</em> (2 <a href="http://arm.com/">ARM</a> cores plus an <a href="http://www.adapteva.com/epiphanyiii/">Epiphany</a> chip with 16 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing">RISC</a> cores). The maker of Parallella, <a href="http://adapteva.com">Adapteva</a>, is on a mission to democratize parallel computing. The company&rsquo;s tag line is <em>Supercomputing for Everyone</em>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Everything in this post is based on the <a href="http://www.parallella.org/quick-start/">official quick start guide created by the Parallella team</a>. These instructions are tailored for a Mac running OS X Mavericks (10.9.3) and a Parallella-16 equipped with the Zynq 7010 chip. I ran into some <em>gotchas</em> during my first Parallella experience. The snags (and solutions) are documented here.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Parallella. Tiny and powerful.' title='Parallella. Tiny and powerful.'><span class='caption-text'>Parallella. Tiny and powerful.</span></span></p>

<h3>Tools Required</h3>

<p>You will need the following items in order to burn an SD card for your
Parallella:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro-SD card, 16GB or greater.</li>
<li>Desktop or laptop computer with a micro-SD card reader, or an SD-card reader with a micro adapter. These instructions are tailored for a Mac. A Linux or Windows machine will work with minor modifications in the procedure.</li>
<li>High-speed internet connection, for downloading Parallella&rsquo;s Ubuntu
image and related files.</li>
<li>Micro-USB-to-USB adapter, for the keyboard and mouse. Parallella is equipped with two micro-USB ports.</li>
<li>Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable or adapter.</li>
<li>Parallella (of course!)</li>
</ul>


<p>Adapteva sells an accessories kit containing an SD card, power adapter, micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, and USB-to-micro-USB adapter. Unless you already have these items, buying the kit may save you time.</p>

<h3>These Steps Could Break Your Primary Machine</h3>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re experimenting with Parallella, we can assume that you are an advanced user. Your computer is already backed up, or you&rsquo;re running these steps on a test machine. And you know <a href="http://RayHightower.com/sudo-disclaimer/">the power and pitfalls of sudo</a>. Technology evolves rapidly, and everything you read here could change by the time you read it.</p>

<h3>Comparison with Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_fan.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Bits get hot. Use a fan.' title='Bits get hot. Use a fan.'><span class='caption-text'>Bits get hot. Use a fan.</span></span>
How does the Parallella compare with other single-board computers, like the <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">Beaglebone Black</a>? The first difference noticed at boot-time: Parallella runs hot! So hot, in fact, that the unit comes with a heat sink and the recommendation to add a fan. I’ve never needed a fan with a Pi or a ‘Bone.</p>

<p>Of course, the Parallella runs hotter because it has more processing power packed tightly together in limited space. Since Parallella is designed to run tasks in parallel, we can expect certain programs to perform faster than they would on the Pi or &lsquo;Bone. Future posts will explore Parallella&rsquo;s performance using languages designed for concurrency, languages like <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Go</a> and <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/06/installing-rubinius-using-rvm/">Rubinius</a>. Now, let’s get started with Parallella.</p>

<h3>Getting the Parallella OS</h3>

<p>Parallella runs a customized version of Ubuntu installed on a micro-SD card. Burning the SD card takes a long time, so it makes sense to start that process first.</p>

<p>Download the files that you will need to burn onto the SD card. I&rsquo;m running Mac OS X on my primary machine, and I&rsquo;m configuring a Parallella-16 with a Zynq 7010 and an HDMI display. Therefore, the files needed for this configuration are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://downloads.parallella.org/ubuntu/dists/trusty/image/ubuntu-14.04-140611.img.gz">Ubuntu 14.04 for Parallella</a> (released June 11, 2014)</li>
<li><a href="http://downloads.parallella.org/boot/linux/kernel-hdmi-default.tgz">Linux kernel with HDMI support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/parallella/parallella-hw/blob/master/fpga/bitstreams/parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin?raw=true">Parallella-16 Zynq 7010 with HDMI display</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Unzip the files and place them in a directory that&rsquo;s handy. You&rsquo;ll need them for the next step. With Mac OS X, you can unzip the files by double-clicking them in <code>Finder</code>.</p>

<p>Note: You might need different files depending on the current date (Parallella software is in a rapid state of flux) and your exact equipment. If your configuration is different, you can make the adjustments described in Parallella&rsquo;s official guide.</p>

<h3>Burn the SD Card</h3>

<p>Insert your SD card into your Mac&rsquo;s SD card reader, and use the Mac OS X <code>diskutil list</code> command to determine the designation of the SD card. If you use portable hard drives with your primary machine, the SD card designation could change from time to time, so it&rsquo;s important to perform this step each time you burn a card.</p>

<p>From this <code>diskutil</code> report, we can see that we want to burn the SD image to <code>/dev/disk1</code>. The other device is the hard drive for my primary machine. Burning the wrong device means destroying data.</p>

<p>To burn the SD card&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Change into the directory where you downloaded the Ubuntu image.</li>
<li>Unmount the destination partition on the SD card.</li>
<li>Use the the <code>dd</code> command to copy the Ubuntu image to the SD card.</li>
</ol>


<p>To execute the above steps as <code>bash</code> commands, do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="o">[</span>directory containing the ubuntu image file<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>ubuntu-14.04-140611.img <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/disk1 <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>64k
</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>dd</code> command takes a <em>long</em> time to run, over 56 minutes on my machine. Here&rsquo;s a quick run-through of the command options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sudo</code> gives you <a href="http://RayHightower.com/sudo-disclaimer/">super powers</a>.</li>
<li><code>dd</code> is the &ldquo;copy and convert&rdquo; command. The letters &ldquo;dd&rdquo; have nothing to do with what the tool actually does. It&rsquo;s just a command name. And like so many things in computer science, the name might be based on a pun.</li>
<li><code>if=</code> specifies the input file. You can include the full path, or if the file is in your current directory, you can omit the path as shown in this example.</li>
<li><code>of=</code> specifies the output file. We know that the SD card is located at <code>/dev/disk</code> so that&rsquo;s where the results of this command are headed.  Note that your destination directory may differ from this one.</li>
<li><code>bs=</code> specifies the block size used for the destination file.</li>
</ul>


<h3>About Block Size</h3>

<p>The Mac section of the official Parallella guide recommends a block size of size of 1 megabyte, while the Linux instructions recommend 64 kilobytes (the option <code>bs=64k</code> in the <code>dd</code> command). I initially used <code>bs=1m</code> on my Mac, and I ran into problems. When I used <code>bs=64k</code>, everything worked fine. Note that I eventually traced my problem to something other than block size (details below) but since the 64k setting still works, I&rsquo;ve left it intact. If I find out why Linux and OS X are using different block sizes, I&rsquo;ll post the information here.</p>

<h3>Checking dd Progress</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/dd_progress.png' width='' height='' alt='Activity Monitor' title='Activity Monitor'><span class='caption-text'>Activity Monitor</span></span>
Waiting an hour for the <code>dd</code> command to run can be disconcerting because the machine does not give any feedback on progress. No gas gauge, spinning indicator, nothing. How do we know if the write process is working?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to check progress. Run Apple&rsquo;s <code>Activity Monitor</code>, and look for <code>dd</code> on the list of processes, as shown in the Activity Monitor screenshot. The number of bytes written will increase slowly while <code>dd</code> burns the Ubuntu image onto the SD card. With the current version of Ubuntu, roughly 7.4GB will be written to the SD. At completion, <code>dd</code> will disappear from the Activity Monitor list and you&rsquo;ll see the following at the command line.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see from the report, it took 3363.824531 seconds (just over 56 minutes) for <code>dd</code> to burn the Ubuntu image onto the SD card. That&rsquo;s a long time to wait with zero feedback. Activity Monitor will tell you what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h3>Confirm Partitions</h3>

<p>To confirm that the partitions have been created and that Ubuntu has been written to the SD card, use <code>diskutil list</code> again.</p>

<p>As expected, <code>/dev/disk0</code> remains unchanged. We want it that way because that&rsquo;s where our primary machine&rsquo;s operating system resides. <code>/dev/disk1</code> (your actual SD card designation may be different) is the target disk we&rsquo;re after. Two new partitions are on the SD card, a FAT32 partition named <code>BOOT</code> and a Linux partition.</p>

<p>Next we need to copy some supporting files to the new <code>BOOT</code> partition.</p>

<h3>Copying Additional Files to the SD Card</h3>

<p>Now that Ubuntu resides on the SD card, it&rsquo;s time to add the files that support HDMI video and the FPGAs. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<p>The additional files will need to be copied to <code>/BOOT</code> on the SD card. While it might make sense to reach the <code>BOOT</code> partition as <code>/dev/disk1</code>, you will actually reach it via <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<p>We target <code>/dev/disk1</code> when burning the Ubuntu image, but to copy the supporting files we target <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>. Both designations point to the same place, the SD card. Why the name switch?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why two different designations are used for the same SD card. I only know that it works. You can expect to see an update posted here if I find an explanation. Or if you have an answer, feel free to post in the comments below.</p>

<p>Before we copy over the files, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s on the <code>BOOT</code> partition on the SD card.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Gotcha #1: The FPGA Bitstream File</h3>

<p>First, change into the directory where you stored the additional Parallella files, and copy the FPGA bitstream file to <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cp parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin /Volumes/BOOT/
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /Volumes/BOOT/
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin parallella.bit.bin
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First gotcha: I made the mistake of simply copying the <code>parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin</code> file without renaming it to <code>parallella.bit.bin</code>. Parallella will only boot when it sees a file with this filename on the SD card&rsquo;s <code>BOOT</code> partition. The original file name will probably change as the software gets updated. With each change, we will need to make sure that the file is renamed <code>parallella.bit.bin</code> on the Parallella.</p>

<p>Obvious in hindsight, but it took me awhile to track that one down!</p>

<h3>Copy the Last Two Files</h3>

<p>Two files were decompressed from <code>kernel-hdmi-default.tgz</code>: <code>devicetree.dtb</code> and <code>uImage</code>. Change into the directory where the files were decompressed, and copy them to <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Eject the SD Card, Insert in Parallella</h3>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to eject the SD card from the Mac and insert it in the Parallella. Plug in the HDMI cable, keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet connection. Power up the Parallella, and welcome to the next <em>gotcha</em>.</p>

<h3>Gotcha #2: Powered USB Required</h3>

<p>Parallella booted to a beautiful GUI, but the system would not respond to the keyboard or mouse. After swapping a few keyboard/mouse combinations, I finally tried a powered USB hub. The powered hub worked.</p>

<p>Through trial and error I learned that the Parallella can handle a single keyboard plugged into the micro-USB port. However, if two devices are plugged in via USB, a powered hub is required. A passive USB hub will not work. A combination keyboard, one with both a keyboard and a trackpad, will also need a powered USB hub.</p>

<h3>Default Login Credentials</h3>

<p>Default login credentials for Parallella are&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>username = linaro</li>
<li>password = linaro</li>
</ul>


<h3>SSH, Vim, Git, etc.</h3>

<p>You can SSH into the Parallella from the network&hellip;</p>

<h3>Scrot for Screenshots</h3>

<p>If you want to take a screenshot of the Parallella display, use <code>scrot</code>.  It comes with the Ubuntu installation. Type <code>scrot</code> at the command line and hit enter. Five seconds later, the entire screen will be captured and stored in a file called <code>[time stamp]_1920x1080_scrot.png</code> in the current directory.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After waiting a year for Parallella to arrive, I&rsquo;m excited to have the device up and running. Future posts will explore the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; behind parallel computing. Thanks Adapteva for helping to democratize supercomputing. Awesome times are ahead!</p>

<a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV is an underwater robot</a> controlled through a web browser. The server-side of the web app is written in Node.js, running on a <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">BeagleBone Black</a> inside the OpenROV.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know Node.js in order to pilot an OpenROV. And you don&rsquo;t need to do anything in this article to construct an OpenROV from a kit. But if you’re the kind of maker who likes to dig deep into a project, you might enjoy exploring Node.js.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Mac OS X and Node.js</h3>

<p>Everything written here applies to Node.js as it runs on Mac OS X. If your local machine runs Linux or Windows, you will need to consult other resources in order to run Node locally.</p>

<h3>Homebrew First</h3>

<p>Make sure you’re running <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a> on your Mac. Homebrew is a seamless way to manage packages on Mac OS X. To install Homebrew&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;</span>install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After installation, confirm that Homebrew is running properly&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew doctor
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Installing Node.js</h3>

<p>Now that Homebrew is installed and running, Node.js can be installed with a single line command.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install node

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Hello World in Node.js</h3>

<p>You know the compter science tradition: The first program in any new language has to say &ldquo;Hello World.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s a sample <code>Hello World</code> program from the official <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> web site, slightly modified to suit OpenROV.</p>

<p>First, create a file called <code>helloworld.js</code> and fill it with the following code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, from the same directory where you saved <code>helloworld.js</code>, run the file from the command line like so&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, open up a web browser on your local machine and navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:1337</code>. You should see a bare-bones web page similar to this one.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov-runs-nodejs.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span></p>

<p>Now that you have Node.js running locally, you&rsquo;re ready to explore the <a href="http://github.com/openrov">OpenROV repo on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Future blog posts about Node.js and OpenROV will consider questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What does Node.js do for OpenROV that other languages can’t do?</p></li>
<li><p>What other languages might we use to control OpenROV? It’s all open source, so our brainstorms could one day turn into actual code running on OpenROV!</p></li>
<li><p>How does Node.js on the BeagleBone Black interact with the Arduino and other OpenROV components?</p></li>
</ul>

<br/>~Frank Sobatka</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/zero-to-maker.gif' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
David Lang is a maker. After a stint with a struggling Silicon Valley startup, David teamed up with former NASA engineer <a href="http://openrov.com/profile/1gupl83kvnk8f">Eric Stackpole</a> to build an underwater robot called <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a>. That&rsquo;s a two-sentence oversimplification of David&rsquo;s maker journey, detailed in his book: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028284.do">Zero to Maker: Learn (Just Enough) to Make (Just About) Anything</a>.</p>

<p>The book starts off like a novel, with the exploration of the mysterious Hall City Cave and an 1840s-era gold robbery. Fast-forward to the present day where a multi-disciplinary team of makers joins forces to create an inexpensive vehicle for underwater exploration.</p>

<p>The author was not a born maker. But through force of will, discipline, and the right mentorship, he grew from non-maker to co-founder of the OpenROV company in roughly one year.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Making is a Team Sport</h3>

<p><em>Zero to Maker</em> will not teach you how to use tools, what to make, or what manuals to read. But it will put you on the path to learning. For example, the author shares his first experience at a <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a>, a gathering for people who make things. Many of the exhibitors have spent decades honing their skills, while some are brand new and full of enthusiasm. Everyone shares knowledge in the Maker community. And as a result, everyone grows.</p>

<p>Maker Spaces are places where tools and expertise are shared on a regular basis. <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> is a maker space in San Francisco where the author got some of his early experience with specialized tools. <a href="http://pumpingstationone.org/">Pumping Station One</a> and <a href="http://www.sshchicago.org/">Southside Hackerspace Chicago</a> shoot for similar goals in Chicago.</p>

<p>The author points out that no matter what you&rsquo;re trying to make, chances are that someone else has made something similar and they can share experience with you. Likewise, you have experience that other makers may find valuable, even on day one of your maker journey. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t know what we know. Maker communities remove the friction so that knowledge can be shared more freely.</p>

<h3>The IKEA Effect</h3>

<p>Why is the maker movement so powerful? The author explores this question in one very interesting section of the book. As it turns out, Researchers at the Harvard Business School think they have the answer. When we put our sweat and effort into building a project, we perceive the project to be more valuable. The researchers refer to this phenomenon as the IKEA effect. If we sweat to build something, it becomes valuable to us.</p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>If you are a maker, or if you want to become a maker, this book is worth reading. And once you&rsquo;re done reading, go make something!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many motors are in the typical automobile? The knee-jerk response might be “one, the big metal thing under the hood”. Upon further reflection, we may recall the motors that operate many devices in today’s automobile: windshield wipers, power windows, door locks, sun roof, reclining seats, and so on. Power devices were once luxury equipment. Today, since motors have fallen in price, most cars include these <em>luxury</em> items as standard equipment.</p>

<p>We take motors for granted, therefore motors have disappeared. And now, as it becomes possible to add a computer and an IP address to almost anything electronic, we bring about the Internet of Things (IoT). Computers are disappearing too.</p>

<h3>ACM Presents Disruptive IoT</h3>

<p>Steven Loving is a director at <a href="http://www.arrayent.com/">Arrayent</a>. Arrayent makes a platform for companies that want their products to be IoT-aware. For example, a garage door company that wants to offer iPhone control to their customers can do so without re-inventing TCP/IP themselves. Arrayent handles the IoT portion so the maker can focus on their core business. Steven shared his vision of the IoT future at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/184091062/">Tuesday&rsquo;s ACM meeting</a>. Some of his ideas are summarized here.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Leave Home Without It</h3>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t leave home without it</em> was once the catch phrase of a major charge card. Today, many of us leave home with just three things in our pockets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wallet</li>
<li>Keys</li>
<li>Smartphone</li>
</ul>


<p>As near-field communication (or one of its descendants) becomes prevalent, we may only need the smartphone.</p>

<h3>Products Don&rsquo;t Matter Any More?</h3>

<p>Products don&rsquo;t matter any more? I immediately wanted to argue against this idea. Everyone wants quality products, right? The point: As manufacturing techniques become common knowledge, companies need to come up with new ways to differentiate themselves from the competition.</p>

<p>Connected products are special. For example, consider an ordinary sump pump. How does a buyer distinguish one from another? If one sump pump contains a tiny embedded Linux system with an IP address, it can alert the owner when water has approached a dangerous level, if there is a power outage, or if flood conditions are simply too strong for the pump to handle. Bad news does not get better with time, and if the sump pump can send bad news early, the owners can take corrective action while there&rsquo;s still time to do so.</p>

<h3>Mobile First</h3>

<p>A great quote from the presentation&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you know anybody building a product with an LCD on it? Shoot them.  I have an LCD in my pocket. It&rsquo;s called a phone.
<br/>~Steven Loving</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the mobile-first strategy that many developers apply to apps also applies to IoT.</p>

<p>Side note: Clearly, Apple gets it. That&rsquo;s one reason why they released <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/">HomeKit</a>.</p>

<h3>Incumbent Companies Are Scrambling</h3>

<p>Why are cable companies offering security services in addition to standard packages of television and movies? Because users are moving to Netflix and Amazon Prime. Cable companies that offer internet service must come up with other services if they expect to survive. IoT might offer a way. Self-installed home monitoring services will give customers a reason to stick with their old cable provider. Of course, this will force security companies like ADT to come up with something new, too.</p>

<h3>IoT Progression</h3>

<p>What opportunities will become available when every device has an IP
address? Tuesday&rsquo;s presenter predicts the following sequence of
events:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connected products.</li>
<li>Connected systems &ndash; products talking to other products.</li>
<li>Communities of systems talking to each other.</li>
<li>Network effects.</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;re currently experiencing &#35;1 and &#35;2. What will happen as &#35;3 and &#35;4 begin to roll out? We cannot be sure. However, we can be certain that this will be an exciting time for software developers, electrical engineers, and entrepreneurs who build companies in those areas.</p>

<h3>Thanks Chicago ACM</h3>

<p>Thanks again Chicago ACM for putting on a great program.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-16T17:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the early days of robots people said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s build a robot&rsquo; and what&rsquo;s the first thought? You make a robot look like a human and do human things. That&rsquo;s so 1950s. We are so past that.
<br/>~Neil deGrasse Tyson</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov-uw.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.' title='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.</span></span>
<a href="http://openrov.com">OpenROV</a> is an underwater robot, roughly the size of a toaster, and definitely not human-shaped. The device is controlled through a Node.js-based web app. Former NASA researcher Eric Stackpole and Make Magazine columnist David Lang are on a mission to democratize ocean exploration in the same way that Jobs and Woz sparked the democratization of  computing. Eric and David pooled their talents to launch OpenROV, building on the foundation laid by Moore’s Law and the open source software movement.</p>

<p>OpenROV&rsquo;s ingredients are an impressive mix of open source goodness&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>BeagleBone Black &ndash; an open-source single-board computer, smaller than a deck of cards, running Linux.</li>
<li>Linux &ndash; specifically, the Ubuntu distribution.</li>
<li>Node.js &ndash; platform for building web applications, based on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. Thanks to Node.js, any laptop running a web browser can control the OpenROV.</li>
<li>Arduino &ndash; inexpensive micro-controller commonly used in robotics projects.</li>
<li>TCP/IP &ndash; the communication protocol of the Internet. TCP/IP handles all communications (commands, video) between the OpenROV and the pilot’s laptop.</li>
</ul>


<p>The OpenROV team has released all of their <a href="https://github.com/openrov">schematics and source code</a> to the open source community, hence the word “open” in the company name. If you think the open source aspects of OpenROV are exciting, wait until you hear about the company&rsquo;s main mission: Underwater exploration.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Eric and David were kind enough to invite me to their lab/manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California recently. Thank you, OpenROV makers!</p>

<h3>Remotely Operated Vehicles</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Laptop, browser, and game controller.' title='Laptop, browser, and game controller.'><span class='caption-text'>Laptop, browser, and game controller.</span></span>
ROV is short for remotely operated vehicle, an underwater robot. Scientists use ROVs to study marine life. Oil companies use ROVs for underwater construction and inspections. Industry-grade ROVs are priced at $30,000 on the low-end, while a <a href="http://www.mbari.org/twenty/Tiburon.htm">custom ROV can cost several million dollars</a>.</p>

<p>The OpenROV team was convinced that they could design and build an ROV small enough to fit in a suitcase, and easy enough for a citizen scientist to assemble and maintain. Targeting the general public meant achieving a relatively low price point: under one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>

<p>They did it. The device is successful, and you can <a href="http://store.openrov.com/">buy an OpenROV</a> kit today for $849.00.</p>

<p>Movements are controlled via a USB-connected video game controller. A Bluetooth-equipped controller should work just as well. Some users will prefer the laptop keyboard; that works too.</p>

<p>In other words, the computer that you’re using to read this article can probably control the OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Citizen Science</h3>

<p>Our world will always need professional scientists, people working in academia and in industry to push the frontier of knowledge. Some scientific problems require the attention of PhD-level professionals, while other problems are better solved through crowdsourcing. Enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen scientist</a>.</p>

<p>Professional scientists are good at analyzing data, because that&rsquo;s what they have trained themselves to do. But data gathering requires less training than analysis. Citizen science and crowdsourcing work when there&rsquo;s an overwhelming volume of data to gather. Or when the breakthrough is beyond the reach of current scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists may be constrained by money, but they tend to be unconstrained by expertise. Therefore they are likely to try solutions that experts would never consider. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">Orville and Wilbur Wright</a> were citizen scientists. Professional scientists pursued solutions for fixed-wing flight prior to the Wright brothers&#8217; success. But since the flight problem defied the known science of the day, new approaches were required.</p>

<p>Amusingly, successful citizen scientists can be outwitted by their own expertise, just like the professionals. For example&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris &hellip;[because] no known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping.
<br/>~Orville Wright</p></blockquote>

<p>Shifting back to the 21st century: Thousands of citizen scientists are using OpenROV to explore oceans and lakes more thoroughly than ever before.</p>

<h3>Open Source On-Site</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/ui-discussion-2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.' title='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.'><span class='caption-text'>Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.</span></span>
On the day I visited the OpenROV factory, other underwater enthusiasts were on-site, working with company engineers on product improvements. One enthusiast is a professional pilot of manned submersibles, underwater vehicles large enough to hold people. This pilot has traveled as deep as 2,000 meters below the ocean&rsquo;s surface! &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking at amperage&rdquo;, she said in a discussion with another enthusiast. A spike in amperage could indicate a ground fault, and batteries drain rapidly when that happens. You do not want to be stuck underwater when the batteries run out.</p>

<p>Another member of the open source community, an engineering veteran with decades of experience at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> and <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a>, translates the operator&rsquo;s feedback into code that might drive the next OpenROV user interface.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how open source works at OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Hardware Testing</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/testing-motor-controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Testing new hardware.' title='Testing new hardware.'><span class='caption-text'>Testing new hardware.</span></span>
I offered to leave when the OpenROV team prepared to test some new components. After working in tech for decades, I&rsquo;ve learned to respect a company&rsquo;s right to protect secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that this is all open source,&rdquo; they told me. &ldquo;The schematics are already online, so there&rsquo;s nothing to hide. Come and watch the test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, they had to remind me about the real meaning of open source!</p>

<p>Four OpenROV makers gathered around a tank of water to test a new motor, controller, and propeller combination. They measured power utilization, propulsion, and temperature. Power utilization is important because the batteries need to last. Temperature matters because we don&rsquo;t want the OpenROV to melt underwater (or fry the fish). And propulsion matters because if the unit can&rsquo;t move, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<p>From the reaction of the team, it looks like they found some good components for the next batch of OpenROV kits.</p>

<h3>Strong Minds Coming Together</h3>

<p>The mood in the OpenROV lab is a blend of excitement and technical expertise. Some of the people in the lab are members of the company. Others are adventurers fascinated with this inexpensive, effective way to explore. All are united in the quest to do something awesome with technology.</p>

<p>OpenROV is what we get when the thirst for exploration blends with the open source movement. What a wonderful combination.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/31/github-page-build-warning-new-cdn/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-31T13:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/31/github-page-build-warning-new-cdn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>RayHightower.com</code> blog is built on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Recently, after I deployed a site update, GitHub emailed me a <code>Page build warning</code> message. Since this was <em>just a warning</em>, I ignored it while I attacked more pressing tasks (not always a good idea).</p>

<p>Today I finally took the time to research the topic so I could figure out what to do next. This article is the result of that research.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What the Message Means</h2>

<p>Here are the important points of the of the <code>Page build warning</code> message:</p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub introduced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery network (CDN)</a> for faster page loads and protection against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of sevice (DOS)</a> attacks.</li>
<li>If you do nothing to your GitHub Pages site, your pages will continue to load normally. People who visit your site will see no difference.</li>
<li>If you want the benefits of the CDN, follow the instructions given in GitHub&rsquo;s blog articles.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Original Message</h3>

<p>Here’s the original message. If you’re satisfied with the above translation, you can skip this section.</p>

<blockquote><p>The page build completed successfully, but returned the following warning:</p>

<p>GitHub Pages recently underwent some improvements (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages</a>) to make your site faster and more awesome, but we&rsquo;ve noticed that rayhightower.com isn&rsquo;t properly configured to take advantage of these new features. While your site will continue to work just fine, updating your domain&rsquo;s configuration offers some additional speed and performance benefits. Instructions on updating your site&rsquo;s IP address can be found at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,">https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,</a> and of course, you can always get in touch with a human at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;">&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x40;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#46;</a> For the more technical minded folks who want to skip the help docs: your site&rsquo;s DNS records are pointed to a deprecated IP address.</p>

<p>If you have any questions please contact us at <a href="https://github.com/contact.">https://github.com/contact.</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>First: Check the CNAME File</h3>

<p>Since <code>RayHightower.com</code> was configured for Octopress a few years ago, it already had a <code>source/CNAME</code> file. To check the contents:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat <span class="nb">source</span>/CNAME
</span><span class='line'>rayhightower.com
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>CNAME</code> file looks fine, according to the GitHub&rsquo;s blog. Time for the next step.</p>

<h3>Next: Domain Records</h3>

<p>The domain is registered with <a href="http://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a>, so the process was relatively quick.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into DNSimple&rsquo;s advanced editor for the domain.</li>
<li>Click <code>Add a Record</code> and select <code>ALIAS</code>.</li>
<li>Leave <code>Name</code> blank.</li>
<li>Next to <code>Alias for</code> enter the GitHub Pages endpoint. In my case, the endpoint is <code>rayhightower.github.io</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>More information on <a href="http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/github-pages/">GitHub Pages and DNSimple</a>.</p>

<p>I set TTL to 1 minute to encourage the changes to propagate quickly. If you know of a better configuration choice for TTL, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Expect Propagation Delays</h3>

<p>DNS changes can take up to a day to propagate. Delays tend to be shorter with DNSimple because time-to-live (TTL) can be set as low as one minute for some records. Updates will be posted here as I learn more.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Grow a User Group]]></title>
    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-30T17:34:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The current team of <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> organizers assumed leadership in August 2007. Back then, typical monthly attendance was about five people and the group&rsquo;s <a href="http://meetup.com/chicagoruby">Meetup.com</a> database contained 78 members. The previous organizer was swamped with work at his day job, so he handed the baton to a new crew.</p>

<p>Today, the <em>new crew</em> has grown ChicagoRuby to over 2,700 members. The group hosts three meetups every month, and the downtown meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. Bonus: ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> in Chicago and <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> on the Caribbean island of Barbados.</p>

<p>How does ChicagoRuby do it? Through consistency, teamwork, iteration, and learning from mistakes.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Be Consistent With Meetings</h3>

<p>Consistency is very difficult in the beginning, especially on that night when only three people show up for the meeting. I have hosted a 3-person ChicagoRuby meeting before. Consistency is hard, and it is also the most important factor in user group success.</p>

<p>People trust consistency. Consistent meetings grow groups.</p>

<p>Members of ChicagoRuby know that we meet on the first Tuesday of every month downtown, the third Saturday of every month in Elmhurst, and one evening per month for the hack night. Members can plan their schedules months in advance because the ChicagoRuby calendar is consistent. Consistency builds trust.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby cancelled one meeting in January 2011 due to a killer snow storm in Chicago. We were forced to cancel because the property manager shut the entire building down. We&rsquo;re a little bit stubborn about consistency. And that&rsquo;s how we build trust.</p>

<p>Yes, there will be times when the organizer is too exhausted to run an upcoming meeting. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to share the work by building a team.</p>

<h3>Build the Team</h3>

<p>ChicagoRuby believes in sharing the work amongst multiple organizers. The group is stronger with several brains at the helm. Today we have eight organizers. Working as a team enables us to benefit from each other’s strengths. Some organizers have strong design skills, others are strong developers. And some are good at asking members for help.</p>

<h3>Ask for Help</h3>

<blockquote><p>I guarantee you that any favor he asks of you, you will offer to do before he requests it.
<br/>~Tom Hagen, Consigliere</p></blockquote>

<p>One way to ask for help: Encourage members to help in their area of enthusiasm. For example, organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights every month. Ginny got started when she approached the organizers after a meeting and said, &ldquo;We should have hack nights.&rdquo; Clearly, she was enthused about hack nights, so we asked her to take the lead in that area.</p>

<p>Today, Ginny’s hack nights are the highest rated of all ChicagoRuby events. In January, she will be a lab advisor at RubyCaribe.</p>

<p>Before he moved to Florida, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattpolito">Matt Polito</a> was part of the ChicagoRuby organizer team. Matt wanted ChicagoRuby to have a logo. I was against it. We were planning the first WindyCityRails and I wanted everyone to focus on the conference. Matt went out and got the logo done anyway. Everybody likes it. Matt, thank you for ignoring me!</p>

<p>Members who have ideas for improvement tend to be strong leaders. The whole group benefits when we get out of the way and let them lead.</p>

<p>The current members of the ChicagoRuby organizer team are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a>, mentioned above.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a> is a developer and an organizer of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/js-chi/">Chicago JavaScript Meetup Group (JS-Chi)</a>. Justin will also be a lab advisor for RubyCaribe in January 2015.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/hugocorbucci">Hugo Corbucci</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/42800032/">Emily Rosengren</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/135529442/">Sam Jacobs</a> are developers at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. Since ThoughtWorkers travel often, ChicagoRuby always invites two or more to be on the organizer team.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/themccreefiles">Alonda McCree</a> manages the downtown meetups, including logistics and video. Alonda is the conference manager for RubyCaribe.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/1345203/">Marty Lavin</a> manages ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s Elmhurst meetups, including logistics and scheduling. Marty is consistently active in Elmhurst, so we asked him to join the team.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rayhightower">Ray Hightower</a>, author of this
article.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to the core group of ChicagoRuby organizers, one person deserves special mention. <a href="http://twitter.com/zolk">Kevin Zolkiewicz</a> has managed every WindyCityRails since the first one in 2008. Kevin&rsquo;s project management, design, and leadership skills are enjoyed by everyone who attends WindyCityRails.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/about/organizers/">ChicagoRuby Organizer Page</a> contains the list of current and past organizers. Many of the former organizers remain active in an emeritus role. Every mind helps to make the group stronger.</p>

<h3>Automate Everything</h3>

<p>Managing a database of 2,700+ members could be drudgery. Fortunately, <a href="http://meetup.com/chicagoruby">Meetup.com</a> makes the process easy. Meetup handles RSVPs, membership additions and deletions, and reminders. Sometimes, the 2-week automated reminder from Meetup.com reminds the organizers to get a speaker for the next meeting!</p>

<p>Early in our history, someone suggested that ChicagoRuby should not use Meetup.com because it&rsquo;s written in PHP, and we&rsquo;re a Ruby group. We see things differently. ChicagoRuby is a Ruby group that uses the best tool for the job, regardless of language. Meetup.com has proven itself useful for eight years and counting.</p>

<h3>Choose a Short Name</h3>

<p>Growth is an ongoing priority for ChicagoRuby. In order to grow, a group has to attract new members. New members who are looking for a group to join are likely to start with a search engine, and search engines adore simplicity.</p>

<p>Our group was originally called <em>The Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group</em>. Accurate, and a mouthful. We discovered that a simple domain name, <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby.org</a>, was available. So we grabbed it, along with the <a href="http://twitter.com/chicagoruby">@ChicagoRuby</a> Twitter handle.</p>

<h3>Be Easy to Find</h3>

<p>To make the group even easier to find, every web site in the ChicagoRuby ecosystem points to all of the group&rsquo;s other web sites. For example, all of the conference sites point to the ChicagoRuby site, and vice versa. A new member who finds one part of the ecosystem will find the whole thing. People feel welcome when information is easy to find.</p>

<p>Making future members feel welcome is key to growth. Free monthly events are another way to make people feel welcome.</p>

<h3>Keep Monthly Events Free</h3>

<p>I firmly believe that monthly user group meetings should be free. We never know what a member of our community is going through financially. Therefore, ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s monthly meetings have always been free.</p>

<p>My personal history includes times when I was dead broke due to one entrepreneurial setback or another. So I have emotional reasons for keeping ChicagoRuby’s monthly events free of charge.</p>

<p>Of course, the money to pay for the meetings has to come from somewhere. That’s where sponsors can help.</p>

<h3>Cover Monthly Costs Through Sponsorships</h3>

<p>Companies will gladly sponsor a group that gives them a return on their investment. Sponsorships don&rsquo;t always come in the form of money.</p>

<p>For example, ChicagoRuby’s first sponsor was <a href="http://www.deforestgroup.com/">DeForest Group</a>. Owners <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leedeforest">Lee DeForest</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-deforest/40/57a/881">Jim DeForest</a> provide ChicagoRuby with free space and WiFi for our Saturday meetings. Lee was one of the five people in the room when the current organizers took over, and we will always be grateful for his early support.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby’s downtown sponsors are <a href="http://enova.com">Enova</a> and <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. Each company provides space, WiFi, pizza, and beverages on a monthly basis. Sponsors get to address the group at the beginning of the meeting. More important, by sponsoring ChicagoRuby over time, a company can build trust within the membership.</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly Media</a> was our first publishing sponsor.  O&#8217;Reilly, <a href="http://www.informit.com/user_groups/">Pearson Education</a>, and <a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a> provide books for ChicagoRuby members to <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/book-reviews/">review</a>.</p>

<p>Sponsors get involved with user groups for two main reasons: To recruit developers, or to market products to developers. Everybody wins when sponsors get involved with user groups, financially or otherwise.</p>

<h3>Vet Speakers</h3>

<p>Members of ChicagoRuby trust the organizers to deliver quality events every month. I dropped the ball one month when I failed to properly vet a speaker. After that meeting, organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/dgiunta">Dave Giunta</a> wrote the first draft of the ChicagoRuby <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/about/speaker-guidelines/">speaker guidelines</a>. We&rsquo;ve word-smithed the guidelines over the years, but the most important parts were created by Dave.</p>

<h3>Make Members Feel Awesome</h3>

<p>We humans have a need to belong to something. The feeling of belonging (awesomeness) can be strengthened when we go out for drinks after an event. Drinks are not necessarily alcohol; when we go to a bar together, some members will have a soda, juice, or coffee. Informal camaraderie makes members feel like members.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby members gather together at a bar for an hour or so after our downtown meetings. In Elmhurst, the meetings end at noon, so we grab lunch together at a local restaurant. The conversation continues, and bonds are formed.</p>

<h3>Maintain Focus, and Explore New Areas</h3>

<p>Focus can lead to excellence. But if our focus is too tight, we might miss the Next Great Thing. How does a group balance between focus and exploration?</p>

<p>Over the years, ChicagoRuby has struggled with focus. We&rsquo;ve experimented with other ventures. We ran a job board for awhile. We ran conferences related to NoSQL and mobile. We moved away from these because they drained our resources, and pulled us away from our core, which is Ruby.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we balance between focus and exploration. The monthly user group meetings are for exploration. Monthly events take minimal resources, so they&rsquo;re ideal for experiments. For example, <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/videos/archives/2013/12/03/ployglot-night/">Polyglot Night</a> in Jan 2014 was very successful. Monthly meetings might explore NoSQL, mobile, or IoT. The Ruby community remains vibrant because we <em>borrow</em> ideas from other communities.</p>

<p>Our conferences focus on Ruby. Conferences require more planning and resources than monthly meetups. So, to maximize efficiency, we build our conferences around our core strength: Ruby. RubyCaribe is the newest example of this focused approach.</p>

<h3>Collaborate With Other Groups</h3>

<p>Collaboration stretches our brains in unexpected and wonderful ways. For our newest ventures, ChicagoRuby is collaborating with developers in the Caribbean, in the island nation of Barbados.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a> is a monthly user group for open source enthusiasts.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> is a brand new conference for intermediate and advanced Ruby developers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Through the new ventures, ChicagoRuby has been introduced to work done by the <a href="https://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/">University of the West Indies at Cave Hill (UWI)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/fst/cmp/staff/colin-depradine.aspx">Dr. Colin Depradine</a>, Dean of the University’s Faculty of Science and Technology, is growing the next generation of scientists and engineers in the Caribbean. Under Dr. Depradine&rsquo;s leadership, UWI encourages collaboration between the sciences. For example, computer scientists are writing software to crunch data related to solar energy research. Looking even further into the future, the UWI team has introduced children as young as eight to programming.</p>

<p>UWI also serves as host to LinuxBarbados. The group is organized by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/143194822/">Maurice Beckles</a>, a Barbados-based open source enthusiast and IT technician at UWI. If you&rsquo;re in Barbados, be sure to ask him about his sink-or-swim introduction to Linux when he worked at a bank!</p>

<p>Notice the pattern: The conference (RubyCaribe) focuses on ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s core strength, Ruby. The monthly user group, LinuxBarbados, is a vehicle for exploring a wide range of topics including Linux, Ruby, embedded devices, and anything related to open source.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A better title for this post might have been <em>One Way to Grow a User Group</em>. Every group will grow differently depending on its particular strengths and interests. Of course, groups that grow are likely to have a few things in common. When a group is built on the pillars of consistency and teamwork, they are likely to succeed in a big way.</p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p>If you’re on Mac OS X, make sure you’re using <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a>. It’s the easiest way to install and manage Unix libraries on the Mac.</p>

<p>It’s usually a good idea to check your current version before upgrading.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git --version
</span><span class='line'>git version 1.9.2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, make sure that Homebrew is current.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>My Homebrew was outdated, so I used <code>brew update</code> to grab the new packages.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/28/an-environment-of-respect-3rd-iteration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/bantik">Coraline Ehmke</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/feministy">Liz Abinante</a> met with three members of the WindyCityRails organizer team: <a href="https://twitter.com/zolk">Kevin Zolkiewicz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/themccreefiles">Alonda McCree</a>, and me. Good dialog. End result: The updated <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/code-of-conduct/">WindyCityRails Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Harassment is a serious issue, and a 140-character tweet will not do the discussion justice. Therefore, the ChicagoRuby organizers have created multiple communication channels for this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email: <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#x64;&#101;&#x6f;&#x66;&#x63;&#x6f;&#110;&#100;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#x68;&#105;&#x63;&#x61;&#x67;&#x6f;&#114;&#117;&#x62;&#x79;&#46;&#111;&#x72;&#103;">&#x63;&#111;&#100;&#x65;&#x6f;&#x66;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#100;&#x75;&#x63;&#116;&#x40;&#x63;&#104;&#x69;&#99;&#x61;&#103;&#x6f;&#114;&#x75;&#x62;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#x67;</a></li>
<li>Any of the contact names listed on the current code of conduct</li>
<li>Phone number listed on the code of conduct</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have concerns in this area, please feel free to use one of the channels. The contact list may change as responsibilities shift within ChicagoRuby. However, there will always be multiple people available to address harassment concerns.</p>

<p>Thank you Coraline and Liz for your work in making this happen. And thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/lostghost">Ken Walters</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/bradsdeals">Brad’s Deals</a> for facilitating the meeting.</p>

<p>Now, let’s go write some code!</p>

    <updated>2014-04-15T17:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/04/15/managing-dotfiles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dotfiles, the configuration files used by Unix-like machines, can become disorganized over time. Entropy rules! This article describes my recent attempt to bring order to dotfile chaos. The steps can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the non-private dotfiles (dotfiles that will be viewed by others on Github) into a directory called <code>~/.dotfiles</code>.</li>
<li>From the <code>home</code> directory, create a symbolic link to each dotfile in the <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory.</li>
<li>Use Git to manage the <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory, and share it on GitHub.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dotfiles are normally hidden when you try to view them in the Mac OS X Finder. To view them from the command prompt, use <code>$ ls -al</code>.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile">.bash_profile</a> in this example has grown to include aliases, path specifications, and a script that shows the current Git branch as part of the command prompt. The file also contains two aliases useful for showing or hiding dotfiles in the Finder: <code>showdots</code> and <code>hidedots</code>.</p>

<h3>Putting Dotfiles in One Directory</h3>

<p>Dotfiles are normally created in the user&rsquo;s home directory. For organization purposes, I moved my non-private dotfiles into a directory called <code>.dotfiles</code>, listed above. Unix makes this easy. First, move to the home directory and create <code>~/.dotfiles</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .dotfiles
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Note: Dotfiles can sometimes include private information. If you don&rsquo;t want to share information in a particular dotfile, don&rsquo;t put it on GitHub!</em></p>

<p>In this example, we&rsquo;ll only move one file, <code>.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> .dotfiles/
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv ../.bash_profile .
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Symbolic Links</h3>

<p>Symbolic links ensure that executables can find our dotfiles as needed.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls -al
</span><span class='line'>total 8
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x   3 rth  staff   102 Apr 14 19:48 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x+ 73 rth  staff  2482 Apr 14 19:47 ..
</span><span class='line'>lrwxr-xr-x   1 rth  staff    34 Apr 14 19:48 .bash_profile -&gt; /Users/rth/.dotfiles/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above example, we created a symbolic link called <code>.bash_profile</code> to the real <code>~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile</code> located in the <code>.dotfiles</code> directory. That way, any program that&rsquo;s looking for the <code>.bash_profile</code> file in the home directory will find what it needs, even though the file is somewhere else.</p>

<h3>Why Use Git to Manage Dotfiles?</h3>

<p>Git is a great tool for managing files that change over time. Dotfiles can change as we install new software or tweak our development environment. If we make a mistake, or if an installation script makes a mistake, we can use Git to roll back in history to a pre-mistake version of the dotfile.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Make All Dotfiles Public</h3>

<p>There are some dotfiles that you don&rsquo;t want to share publicly. For example, <code>.bash_history</code> contains all of the commands that have been executed in the shell. Do you really want the world that you sometimes <code>$ ssh myuserid@[embarassingdomainname].com</code>? Probably not. If you think that a dotfile might contain personal or confidential information, no need to broadcast it.</p>

<h3>Learning More About Dotfiles</h3>

<p>Most of my dotfiles, like <code>.bash_profile</code>, don&rsquo;t contain anything private. In fact, most of what I know about dotfiles has come from other developers via books, user groups, blogs, and spelunking through GitHub. Dotfile collections by <a href="https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix">Hashrocket</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">Thoughtbot</a> are  especially good. My <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory is available for public viewing on <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/.dotfiles">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re doing something especially cool with your dotfiles, let&rsquo;s hear about it!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
&nbsp;<br/>
~ L. Peter Deutsch</p></blockquote>

<p>Recursion is available in many high-level languages, including Ruby. Recursive solutions can be joyfully elegant. At the same time, the pursuit of elegance can lead to unexpected performance pitfalls.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can use optimization techniques to address performance problems before they occur. Memoization is one technique in our arsenal.</p>

<h3>Before Memoization</h3>

<p>Memoization was designed to solve a particular kind of problem. Consider a method called <code>fibo(n)</code> that calculates the <em>nth</em> number of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a> sequence.</p>

<p>The example runs, but performance slows down as <em>n</em> gets larger. Why? Because this method re-calculates all preceeding Fibonacci numbers every time it calculates a new <code>fibo(n)</code>. When we calculate Fibonacci numbers manually, we know better. Humans are smart enough to refer to earlier work. But the <code>fibo(n)</code> method does not manage time very well.</p>

<p>Is it possible for the <code>fibo(n)</code> method to remember the results of earlier calculations so that it can avoid doing work that is already done? Yes, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>.</p>

<h3>Memoization</h3>

<p>Memoization means recording the results of earlier calculations so that we don&rsquo;t have to repeat the calculations later. If our code depends on the results of earlier calculations, and if the same calculations are performed over-and-over again, then it makes sense to store interim results (jot results down on a &lsquo;memo&rsquo; = memoization) so that we can avoid repeating the math.</p>

<p>The Fibonacci example can be improved through memoization as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a place to store temporary results.</li>
<li>Before performing a calculation, find out if the calculation has
already been done. If so, use the stored result.</li>
<li>If this is our first time calculating a particular <code>fibo(n)</code>, store
the results for future use.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s how memoization is implemented in the Fibonacci example:</p>

<p>Walking through the code&hellip; First we create a memoization array, a place to store the pre-calculated values. In this example, <code>@scratchpad[]</code> serves as our memoization array.</p>

<p>The <code>fibo(n)</code> method is similar to the one in the earlier example, with a few subtle differences. First, we need to determine whether we&rsquo;ve already calculated a particular value. Since we initialized all elements of the <code>@scratchpad</code> array with the <code>:notcalculated</code> symbol, it&rsquo;s easy to figure out where work needs to be done. If a Fibonacci number <code>fibo(n)</code> has already been calculated, we return the value stored at <code>@scratchpad[n]</code>. Otherwise, we calculate the new <code>fibo(n)</code> and store that value at <code>@scratchpad[n]</code> for later use.</p>

<h3>Performance Comparison</h3>

<p>The performance of the two programs is compared in this 1-minute video.</p>

<p>As the video shows, memoization is a performance booster.</p>

<p>What happened? It just ran a few minutes ago, right before the upgrade! Was RubyMotion broken? Was it time to reach out to the Twitterverse or Stack Overflow for assistance?</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<h3>Cooler Heads</h3>

<p>Every time RubyMotion build an app, it stores the results in the <code>./build</code> directory. Since I had just done an upgrade, it was possible that remnants from a <code>v 2.24</code> build were interfering with my new <code>v 2.26</code> build. The solution?</p>
