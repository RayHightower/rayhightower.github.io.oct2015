Moore’s Law is about to run into a wall. Therefore, anything that software developers can learn about concurrency will be critical in coming years. Enter <a href="http://www.jruby.org/">JRuby 9000</a>.</p>

<h3>What is JRuby?</h3>

<p>JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM). Advantages of running on the JVM include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reaping the performance benefits that come from decades of JVM tuning.</li>
<li>The ability to call time-tested Java libraries from Ruby programs.</li>
<li>The performance benefits that come from concurrency, built into the JVM.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing JRuby 9000 on OS X</h3>

<p>Grab the latest <code>.tar</code> file from <a href="http://jruby.org/download">JRuby Downloads</a> and extract it by double-clicking on it. As of this writing, the latest version was <code>jruby-bin-9.0.0.0.pre1.tar.gz</code>.</p>

<p>Next, move the extracted files to <code>/opt/jruby/</code>. For example, if you downloaded the <code>.tar</code> file to your <code>~/Downloads</code> directory, this command will rename the extracted directory to <code>jruby/</code> in the process.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, add the following line to <code>~/.bash_profile</code> (or where ever you choose to set your <code>$PATH</code> variable).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Testing the JRuby 9000 installation</h3>

<p>To test the JRuby 9000 installation, re-start your terminal or use <code>$ source ~/.bash_profile</code>. And then</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Why not RVM?</h3>

<p>Given that <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">I like RVM</a>, why didn’t I simply use RVM to install JRuby 9000? Answer: The instructions for installing <em>a pre-release version</em> of JRuby via RVM were unclear to me. Extracting the executables and adding the directory to the <code>$PATH</code> was more grok-able. If your experience is different from mine, feel free to share in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Next steps include experiments with concurrency. JRuby concurrency experiments with the <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">18-core Parallella</a> look especially interesting. More to come.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-27T21:04:11-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/02/27/raspberry-pi-2-model-b-quad-core</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/raspberry_pi_2_model_b.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Raspberry Pi 2 Model B' title='Raspberry Pi 2 Model B'><span class='caption-text'>Raspberry Pi 2 Model B</span></span>
The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> has upped their entry in the single-board computer competition. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B boasts a quad core ARM CPU and 1GB of RAM. More important: Benchmarks show that the board is 6x faster than the previous model. And the performance bump has been achieved while the price remains low: Roughly $45.</p>

<p>Getting the board up and running is easier, too. You can buy a pre-built Linux image on micro SD. Or you can <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">download the New Out Of the Box (NOOBS) image</a> yourself. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, you can be up in running in less than an hour.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Easier Than Before</h3>

<p>Special note about the NOOBS image: You don&rsquo;t need a special utility to burn an SD card like before. The steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">NOOBS image</a> and unzip it.</li>
<li>Format a micro SD card that&rsquo;s at lease 4GB in size.</li>
<li>Drag the unzipped NOOBS files to the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Insert the micro SD card into the Raspeberry Pi, apply power, and watch it boot.</li>
</ul>


<p>Having done things <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">the old way</a>, I was surprised that the process was so simple this time. Hats off to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for a great installation experience.</p>

<h3>Login Information</h3>

<p>After the device boots, you will need login credentials. These have not changed from the previous version:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>raspberripi login: pi
</span><span class='line'>Password: raspberry
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the cursor will not move while you type the password.</p>

<p>Next, start the X Window environment.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>startx
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And your desktop will look something like this.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/raspberry_pi_2_model_b_ruby.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Screenshot: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B' title='Screenshot: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B'><span class='caption-text'>Screenshot: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B</span></span></p>

<h3>Running Ruby, Rails</h3>

<p>This incarnation of Raspberry Pi comes with Ruby 1.9.3 pre-installed. Of course, if you want to manage multiple versions of Ruby, <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM is a great way to go</a>.</p>

<p>To install RVM, first run <code>gpg</code> to verify that you will get an uncorrupted (or un-tampored with) version of RVM.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, install RVM.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="se">\c</span>url -sSL https://get.rvm.io <span class="p">|</span> bash -s stable
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, let the current terminal session know that RVM is installed
by typing the following at the command line.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> /home/pi/.rvm/scripts/rvm
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can verify that RVM is installed by checking its version number like so&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm --version
</span><span class='line'>rvm 1.26.10 <span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span> by Wayne E. Seguin &lt;wayneeseguin@gmail.com&gt;, Michal Papis &lt;mpapis@gmail.com&gt; <span class="o">[</span>https://rvm.io/<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Installing Ruby Versions</h3>

<p>To install the latest stable version of Ruby&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm install ruby
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>RVM will download dependencies as part of the installation process. From there, you can create RVM gemsets and <code>gem install rails</code> or any other libraries you may need. More documentation can be found at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.</p>

<p>Enrolling in the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296">Chicago SICP study group</a>, I expected to dive into Lisp. I expected to be challenged. What I didn’t expect: The fun, somewhat irreverent attitude of the SICP authors. And why not? Software development is one of our newest professions. Other professionals are made more effective through our work. Everybody benefits from the increase in productivity.</p>

<p>If you are a software developer in the Chicago area, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296">the SICP group</a>. As the SICP authors say, you don’t need to know Lisp to embark on this path; you’ll learn Lisp as we travel along. And our brains will be stretched in new and interesting ways.</p>

<h3>Installing Scheme on Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Examples and exercises in SICP are written in Scheme, a dialect of the LISP programming language. As of this writing, installing <code>mit-scheme</code> via Homebrew <em>did not work for me</em>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>brew install mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>Error: No available formula <span class="k">for </span>mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>Searching formulae...
</span><span class='line'>Searching taps...
</span><span class='line'>homebrew/x11/mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Update: Some members of the SICP study group had success installing <code>mit-scheme</code> with Homebrew, while others (like me) did not. We did not determine why some of the Homebrew installations were successful. However, the non-Homebrew method described in this article seems to work across-the-board.</em></p>

<p>Alternative solution: Grab a pre-compiled binary from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">MIT/GNU Scheme</a> site. The <code>mit-scheme-9.2-x86-64.dmg</code> disk image was the right one for my early 2013 MacBook Pro. Your system may be different.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/gnu_float.png' width='' height='' alt='Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.' title='Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.'><span class='caption-text'>Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.</span></span></p>

<p>To install, drag the <code>MIT/GNU Scheme.app</code> icon into the Applications folder on the Mac.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Symlinks</h3>

<p>Scheme is run from the command line. In order to make that work, we need to setup two symbolic links.</p>

<p>First, create a symbolic link called <code>mit-scheme-x86-64</code> in your home directory that links to the appropriate executable in the <code>/Applications</code> directory. In other words&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /Applications/MIT<span class="se">\:</span>GNU<span class="se">\ </span>Scheme.app/Contents/Resources /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, setup a symlink that will let us simply type <code>scheme</code> when we want to use this version of the language&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64/mit-scheme /usr/bin/scheme
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Confirm that the links are in place by checking the <code>scheme</code> version number.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you are like me, you will laugh at the gladiator message at the end of the version info.</p>

<h3>Better Way to Symlink?</h3>

<p>Why not create a single symbolic link directly from the <code>Resources</code> directory to the <code>scheme</code> command in <code>/usr/bin</code>? I am not certain, but I suspect it has something to do with expectations within the Scheme interpreter. The interpreter may be expecting certain files to be in certain directories. I’ll update this article when I learn more.</p>

<h3>Running Scheme</h3>

    <updated>2015-01-22T17:48:08-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/01/22/context-changes-everything</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some cases where time zone information is absolutely critical. For example: When scheduling a video conference that crosses national boundaries.</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Google sent me a reminder about today&rsquo;s <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a> meeting. The group meets via video conferencing software over the web. Google&rsquo;s reminder was confusing because it showed the time without the time zone (screenshot below). LinuxBarbados is based in the Caribbean, and some of the members participate from other time zones.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/GH_time_zone_arrow.png' width='' height='' alt='What time is it when the time zone is unknown?' title='What time is it when the time zone is unknown?'><span class='caption-text'>What time is it when the time zone is unknown?</span></span></p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s automated reminder said <code>3pm - 4pm</code> with no time zone reference. How confusing! Members of the group received the same automated reminder with the same information, regardless of time zone. A small change, displaying the time as <code>3pm - 4pm (CST)</code> would solve the problem.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Other Context Examples</h3>

<p>When people speak with each other directly, context is implied. But when communication happens in printed form, it&rsquo;s helpful to have the context in print, too. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walking down the street, you see a poster advertising a concert on January 29th. No year is shown. Is this an old poster for a concert that happened last year on Jan 29th? Or is the event happening next week?</li>
<li>A restaurant menu offers delivery service. Just call the number, and order your food. The phone number is seven digits long, with no area code. Most customers would abandon the menu in favor of a restaurant with more complete information.</li>
<li>Following the train of thought in the previous example: Since phone service has fallen in price, many people call internationally on a more regular basis. A complete phone number should include the country code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Context changes everything. Something all of us need to remember.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-02T23:34:04-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/01/02/no-windows-stronger-planes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is always good to start the new year with something inspirational. <a href="http://www.technicondesign.com/">Technicon Design</a> created a 3-minute video to demonstrate their IXION Windowless Jet Concept. Worth watching full screen.</p>

<center><iframe name="windowlessjet" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/78458486" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<p>How can a plane with no windows offer better views for passengers?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Windows vs Fuselage Strength</h3>

<p>When we add a window to the fuselage of an airplane, we reduce the strength of the fuselage. Glass is weaker than aluminum. So aircraft engineers need to make up for the lost strength. The engineers might add a support structure, thicken the aluminum, or try a different alloy.</p>

<p>But when windows are eliminated, structural integrity is maintained. And the weight of the plane can be reduced because we can eliminate the extra supports.</p>

<h3>How Do We See Without Windows</h3>

<p>As shown in the Technicon video, views can be better without windows!  Cameras are mounted at strategic points on the outside of the plane. And the inner surface of the plane, the part that passengers can see, is covered with a display material. Computers take the images captured by the external cameras, and they translate that into images for display on the inner walls of the plane.</p>

<p>The result: Passengers feel like they&rsquo;re flying in a glass plane. That&rsquo;s an idea best communicated through the Technicon video.</p>

<h3>Applying Tech Across Industries</h3>

<p>Processing power continues to fall in price. Flat panel monitors get less expensive each day. The window-less plane shows us what can happen when advances in one industry are applied to another. Blend these advances with a high-speed internet connection delivered via satellite, and the Internet of Things (IoT) takes a great leap forward. Cross-discipline engineering is exciting.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/31/looking-inside-pygments/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-31T16:18:29-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/31/looking-inside-pygments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog uses <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/pygments.rb">pygments.rb</a> for syntax highlighting. Recently <code>pygments.rb</code> stopped working, so I had to dig inside to determine the problem and apply a solution.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: Pygments didn&rsquo;t simply stop working. I applied updates related to Octopress and Lunr.js, and then it stopped working. So the root cause is me! Rather than back-out the updates, I decided to push forward because Lunr.js will improve the search experience for visitors. Search options will be discussed in a future post.</p>

<h3>Starting With the Error Message</h3>

<p>As with all <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> based blogs, the <code>$ rake generate</code> command creates a new set of static pages every time the command gets run. Normally the process is smooth. Here&rsquo;s the error message that resulted this morning.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What unknown language? Something was fishy. Fortunately, <code>pygments</code> is an open source plugin. Solving the problem was non-trivial, but doable.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Exploring Pygments Internals</h3>

<p>Google, Stack Overflow, and the Octopress documentation gave clues on where to explore. Adding a few lines to <code>source/plugins/pygments_code.rb</code> provided insights on what <code>pygments</code> was &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Observing the Results, Applying a Solution</h3>

<p>Next step: Run <code>$ rake generate</code> and see what happens. Turns out that the lastest version of <code>pygments</code> halted for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of my older blog posts did not contain a space between the triple-backtick characters and the name of the language being highlighted. Earlier versions of <code>pygments</code> did not care, but the current version is a stickler.</li>
<li><code>pygments</code> appears to want a blank line between any triple-backtick line and any other text in the blog post.</li>
</ul>


<p>Vim-fu allowed me to apply solutions with minimal manual work. And now <code>pygments</code> works well.</p>

<p>On to search, to be discussed in a future blog post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/owc_ssd.jpg' width='' height='' alt='MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.' title='MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.'><span class='caption-text'>MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.</span></span>
Every computer user has to deal with this at some point. Your machine runs out of storage space: hard drive, SSD, or whatever mass storage you happen to use. In my case, the 512GB SSD in my early 2013 MacBook Pro was over 90% full. Time for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Fortunately (and contrary to what the Apple literature says) it is possible to upgrade the SSD in a MacBook Pro. RAM is different because the MBP&rsquo;s RAM is soldered to the logic board. But the SSD plugs into a socket. The SSD upgrade path is well-documented on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Ordered from OWC</h3>

<p>Ordering an SSD from Amazon would have saved a few bucks, but I chose <a href="https://www.macsales.com/">Other World Computing</a> instead. Past experience with OWC has been outstanding. The company consistently offers high-performance gear. It was all a matter of trust.</p>

<p>On the day my 960GB SSD arrived, I smacked myself on the forehead. I realized (too late) that I forgot to order a screwdriver for the special pentalobe screws that hold the MacBook Pro together.</p>

<h3>Screwdrivers Included</h3>

<p>But&hellip; When I opened the SSD box from OWC, I was pleasantly surprised. A pentalobe screwdriver was included in the SSD kit, along with a six-point Torx screwdriver. Both screwdrivers are needed for the installation. Thanks to OWC’s forethought, my upgrade plans moved forward undisturbed.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the SSD upgrade was waiting <em>patiently</em> for the Time Machine restoration to complete.</p>

<p>OWC thinks ahead.</p>

<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>

<p><a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> turned twenty years old today. Whenever I experience outstanding service from a company, I pause to think about how to apply the lesson to WisdomGroup and all of our related ventures. The lesson in this case: Think ahead. Anticipate the needs of the customer. And fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Thanks OWC for making the SSD upgrade process as seamless as possible. And thanks for the business lesson, too!</p>

    <updated>2014-12-22T12:07:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/22/too-soon-for-alpha-centauri</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bad news&#58; I have decided to cancel <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> for 2015. Ticket sales are insufficient to cover the cost of the event. <del>Every person who bought a ticket will receive a full refund.</del> All tickets sales have been refunded.</p>

<p>Barbados is a beautiful island nation with welcoming people, a university that leads in multiple technical areas, and a thriving economy. The RubyCaribe (pronounced ka-REEB) organizers will make the event happen in some form at some point in the future. Just not now.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h3>Alpha Centauri</h3>

<p>NASA has launched successful missions to the Moon, Mars, and other bodies in our solar system. NASA would like to visit Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light years away. But they will only launch an Alpha Centauri mission after key prerequisites (maybe the theoretical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive">Alcubierre drive</a>) are in place.</p>

<p>It’s too soon for Alpha Centauri, right now. But one day, humans will get there.</p>

<p>The RubyCaribe team has achieved eight years of success with <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>, <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a>, and events focused on NoSQL and mobile technologies. With that track record, I believed that we could make RubyCaribe work in 2015. But reality disagrees with me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too soon for RubyCaribe, right now. But we will get there.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/LinuxBarbados-tux-logo_300.png' width='' height='' alt='LinuxBarbados.org' title='LinuxBarbados.org'><span class='caption-text'>LinuxBarbados.org</span></span></p>

<h3>Upside: LinuxBarbados</h3>

<p>While planning RubyCaribe, our team began an amazing relationship with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill (<a href="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/">UWI</a>). We collaborated with UWI to create <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a>. The monthly LinuxBarbados meetings are an exciting way to grow your open source software and hardware skills. Discussions cover Linux, Parallella, Raspberry Pi, Ruby, Java&hellip; and more.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in Barbados, you can attend in person on the UWI campus. If you&rsquo;re not in Barbados, you can still participate because every LinuxBarbados meeting includes a live video conference. Sign up at <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados.org</a> if you&rsquo;d like to know more.</p>

<h3>Next Steps for RubyCaribe</h3>

<p>Moving forward, our team will take an Alpha Centauri approach to RubyCaribe. We will get there. And we invite you to enjoy the journey with us.</p>

<p>Do you have thoughts about RubyCaribe? If so, you&rsquo;re welcome to <a href="http://RayHightower.com/contact">share via the contact form</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/18/git-vulnerability-on-mac-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-18T17:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/18/git-vulnerability-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> core team announced a security vulnerability and a corresponding fix. Hats off to the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> team (yes, Mercurial!) for finding the problem. Hats off to the <code>Git</code> team for making the announcement, and for delivering a fix so quickly.</p>

<h3>What’s the Problem?</h3>

<p>If your Git installation remains un-patched, then a malicious person could over-write the <code>.git/config</code> directory in one of your repositories. This would allow them to alter your Git history and make changes in the repo without your knowledge. <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1853266">Details</a>.</p>

<p>The vulnerability exists on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. This article will discuss solving the problem on Mac OS X only, since that is my primary development platform.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Mac and Windows users are exposed because their file systems are not case-sensitive by default. Linux users who use a case-sensitive file system are protected. But Linux users might want to apply the patch anyway because (as stated by the Git core team):</p>

<blockquote><p>Even though the issue may not affect Linux users, if you are a hosting service whose users may fetch from your service to Windows or Mac OS X machines, you are strongly encouraged to update to protect such users who use existing versions of Git.
~Git Core Team</p></blockquote>

<h3>Is My Machine Vulnerable?</h3>

<p>I know that my machine was vulnerable because I was running an un-patched version of Git, as seen below.</p>

<h3>Avoid Conflicts With Apple&rsquo;s Git</h3>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/kcocev">Kristjan Cocev</a> notes in the comments below, Mac OS X comes with its own Git installation. By the time you bought the machine, that pre-installed version is probably out of date. My pre-installed Git was:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>/usr/bin/git --version
</span><span class='line'>git version 1.9.3 <span class="o">(</span>Apple Git-50<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git isn&rsquo;t bad, but here&rsquo;s the problem. Depending on how your <code>PATH</code> variable is setup, there might be a conflict between Apple-installed Git and the one you installed via Homebrew.</p>

<p>Here are two alternatives for fixing the conflict before it causes problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change your <code>PATH</code> variable so that Homebrew-installed Git is executed long before Apple-installed Git gets reached, OR&hellip;</li>
<li>Rename Apple-installed Git as follows:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git-apple
</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>So now, if you want to use Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git (unlikely) you can simply navigate to <code>/usr/bin/git-apple</code>.</p>

<h3>Open Source Rocks</h3>

<p>Again, hats off to everyone in the open source community who pulled together to make this fix happen!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/10/30/chicagoruby-expands-to-north-shore/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-30T14:51:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/10/30/chicagoruby-expands-to-north-shore</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Long-time observers of ChicagoRuby know that the group is always striving to achieve more. Latest move: ChicagoRuby is now hosting a monthly meetup on Chicago’s North Shore. The first meeting of ChicagoRuby: North Shore will be held on Saturday, December 6, 2014 at 10:30am. Visit <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/216193202/">Meetup.com</a> for details and to RSVP.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Why the North Shore?</h3>

<p>Why expand to Chicago’s North Shore? One reason: Several ChicagoRuby members live there, and travelling to meetings downtown and in Elmhurst can be quite a haul.</p>

<p>The bigger reason: Two members have stepped up to manage the north shore operation. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/61690512/">Doug Harman</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/13463131/">Stu Gerstein</a> have been active in Elmhurst for a long time. They were chosen as organizers because they are vocal and they have already done the preliminary leg work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we roll in ChicagoRuby. Many years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> demonstrated that if you push for a new activity in ChicagoRuby (like hack nights) you might end up running it!</p>

<h3>Exciting Year</h3>

<p>2014 has proven to be an exciting year for ChicagoRuby. So far, the group has…</p>

<ul>
<li>Collaborated with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, Barbados to form <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a>.</li>
<li>Built alliances with top-notch developers in multiple countries to create <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a>.</li>
<li>Expanded the monthly Chicago-area activities to four per month.</li>
<li>Grown the organizer team to ten (10) members.</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking forward to more!</p>

I am grateful that the group invited me to present. Outline (prepared in advance):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>30 minutes: Overview of Ruby, Rails, and some alternatives to both. What are the advantages and disadvantages of building web apps with Ruby? Can you build a business with this stuff?</p></li>
<li><p>30 minutes: Questions and Answers. This will be a highly interactive time. Anything discussed earlier is fair game. We can explore technical specifics if you like.</p></li>
<li><p>60 minutes: Deep dive into anything the group wants to explore related to technology, business, or the combination of the two. If the group doesn&rsquo;t choose a topic, we will end early. But if the group is interested and engaged, we will continue.</p></li>

    <updated>2014-09-10T18:40:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/10/manage-that-openrov-tether</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_tether_management_slip_ring.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV tether management, one way that works.' title='OpenROV tether management, one way that works.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV tether management, one way that works.</span></span>
<em>Note: This article has been updated with more photos and details describing slip ring installation.</em></p>

<p>Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> before I built a good tether management system. Bad idea! It&rsquo;s better to have a tether management plan (any plan) before you pilot your OpenROV.</p>

<p>This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have devices that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that fits you.</p>

<h3>Off-the-Shelf Parts</h3>

<p>This tether management system is constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts. The main component is an <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/KAB-Enterprise-Co-Ltd-20-ft-16-3-Cord-Reel-with-4-Outlets-CR002/100661463">extension cord reel sold by Home Depot</a> for about $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and you’re good to go.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_lake_michigan.png' width='' height='' alt='Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.' title='Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.'><span class='caption-text'>Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.</span></span></p>

<h3>Slip Ring</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/adafruit_slip_ring.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Adafruit slip ring.' title='Adafruit slip ring.'><span class='caption-text'>Adafruit slip ring.</span></span>
The slip ring is central to this solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to spin while electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/736?gclid=CJDMiPma1cACFQoEaQod1iwAFQ">Adafruit</a> for about $18.00.</p>

<h3>How to Install the Slip Ring</h3>

<p>First, pull the entire orange cable out of the extension cord reel. It would be great to keep the whole orange cable as part of the tether, but then we wouldn’t have room for the original tether (twisted pair). Cut the orange cable so that only one meter remains attached to the reel assembly.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_tether_management_internals.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Front view, back view, internal view.' title='Front view, back view, internal view.'><span class='caption-text'>Front view, back view, internal view.</span></span></p>

<p>Next, take the extension cord reel apart. Two phillips-head screws hold the device together. Remove the two screws, and the two orange disks will fall apart.</p>

<p>Now let’s focus on the disk without the electrical plugs. You will need to cut a hole in the exact center of this disk. The hole will need to be large enough to let the thicker part of the slip ring through, while allowing enough of an edge for the flange screws. The photos give a clearer picture than the words in this paragraph.</p>

<p>After you insert the slip ring, drill holes for the three slip ring mounting screws. One way to do this: Drill one hole first, insert the screw, tighten the nut, and then measure/drill the remaining holes. You’re more likely to align all of the holes correctly this way.</p>

<h3>Loctite Threadlocker</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/slip_ring_loctite.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Loctite oozing from the screws.' title='Loctite oozing from the screws.'><span class='caption-text'>Loctite oozing from the screws.</span></span>
<a href="http://www.loctiteproducts.com/threadlockers.shtml">Loctite</a> makes a threadlocker, a gummy substance that keeps screws from jiggling loose. They also make super glue; that&rsquo;s not what you want for this project. If you use Loctite&rsquo;s threadlocker on the slip ring screws, they will remain tight until you remove them on purpose.</p>

<h3>Connecting Inside the Reel</h3>

<p>Take a look inside the reel. You’ll see black, green, and white cables inside. You won’t need to do anything with the black cable. Splice the green line from the slip ring to the green line inside the reel, and splice the white slip ring line with the white reel line. Your technique may vary, but I used a combination hook splice, solder, hot glue, and heat shrink tubing. If you wear a belt and suspenders your pants will never fall down!</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_extra_tab.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.' title='Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.'><span class='caption-text'>Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.</span></span></p>

<h3>Gotcha: Removing the Extra Tab</h3>

<p>After initial assembly, I noticed that there was an extra tab inside of the reel. I don’t know the original purpose for the tab, but since it appeared to interfere with tether operation, it had to go. Wire clippers and a dremel tool made quick work of the tab. The before &amp; after photos tell the story.</p>

<h3>Attaching the Tether &amp; Topside Adapter</h3>

<p>Now that you have a functioning reel with a slip ring, attach the twisted pair tether to the 1-meter orange extension cable. Hook splice, solder, hot glue, and heat shrink did the trick for me.</p>

<p>The topside adapter can be attached to the top of the reel with Velcro, as shown in the photos throughout this article. Plug the green and white cables from the outer slip ring into the topside adapter, and you&rsquo;re ready to test the new tether management system.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/nanuk_935_openrov.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.' title='Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.'><span class='caption-text'>Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.</span></span>
What should we do with the slip ring&rsquo;s extra lines? I tied mine together for future use. I may cut them if I decide that they&rsquo;re not useful. If you have other ideas, feel free to post in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Everything Fits</h3>

<p>The new tether management system is small enough to share space with an OpenROV inside a <a href="http://nanukcase.com/productdetails.asp?node=205">Nanuk 935 case</a>. The Nanuk case has wheels, a foam interior, and it is rugged and small enough to fly as an airline carry-on.</p>

<p>Whip everything out and you&rsquo;re ready to explore.</p>

<p>This article describes a simple hardware hack: Making the <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">Parallella</a> run on solar energy.</p>

<p>Motivation: The fastest computers in the world gulp electricity at an alarming rate. For example, <a href="http://www.top500.org/system/177999">Tianhe-2</a> at the National Super Computer Center in Guangzhou, China uses 17.8 megawatts of energy per year. In dollars, that’s roughly $17 million spent on electricity spent each year, depending on how the electricity is sourced.</p>

<p>Scientists at <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> estimate that the earth&rsquo;s surface absorbs enough solar energy in ninety minutes to power every electrical device on the planet for a full year. A year&rsquo;s worth of energy in ninety minutes! Surely we can use some of that energy to power our supercomputers.</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<p>The solar Parallella idea was driven by a few observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parallella only needs five watts of power, five volts at 1 ampere. The device might spike at startup or during heavy calculations, but not by much.</p></li>
<li><p>USB provides electrical power at five volts, typically less than 2 amperes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phone solar chargers are easy to find. These pocket-sized chargers provide power over USB.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Can a cell phone solar charger be hacked to power Parallella? Yes!</p>

<h3>Building the Hybrid Cable</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_usb_solar.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Making the connections.' title='Making the connections.'><span class='caption-text'>Making the connections.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, get an off-the-shelf solar device capable of providing 5 volts at 2 amperes. Many cell phone solar chargers will do this, but some will only provide 1 ampere of current. You will need 2 amperes. As of this writing, Amazon sells solar cell phone chargers for about $35.00. Note that the model shown in this article combines a photovoltaic panel with a lithium ion battery. Energy provided by the sun can be stored by the battery for later use.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut open a USB cable to expose power (red), ground (black), and signal cables (green and white) as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an old AC adapter cable that fits the Parallella power connection. Cut it open to expose the power and ground wires as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Solder the USB power to the old adapter power wire, and USB ground to the adapter&rsquo;s ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover everything with heat shrink tubing or electrical tape. Heat shrink is preferred since it will last longer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re done! Plug everything in and watch your Parallella boot up. Note that this configuration will also power the Parallella&rsquo;s cooling fan.</p>

<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>

<p>It probably doesn’t make sense to call this a project. It&rsquo;s more of a proof of concept. Scaling up will cost money and time. But the benefits of solar energy, including cost savings and reduced carbon footprint, make this a worthwhile path to pursue.</p>
