<p>Fortunately, I‚Äôm running <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a>. After the standard <code>brew doctor</code> and <code>brew update</code>, the following resolved the MacVim problem:</p>

Entrepreneurs, especially those outside of software development, may find this article useful.</p>

<h3>When Performance Matters</h3>

<p>Over seventy percent of the web servers on the planet run Linux, the open source operating system. Google, Facebook, and Amazon all run Linux. They bet their companies on this decision every day.</p>

<p>Given that thousands of successful companies have bet their livelihood on open source, an observer might ask these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is open source?</li>
<li>Why should one care about open source?</li>
<li>How can a company profit from software that is given away for free?</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<h3>Source Code, Executable Code</h3>

<p>First, a few definitions. Source code is a human-modifiable form of software. It‚Äôs software as written by programmers. Source code must be translated into executable code (either compiled or interpreted) before a computer can run it.</p>

<p>Water is a useful metaphor for this discussion. Water can exist in three different states (steam, liquid, and ice) without changing its chemical properties. It‚Äôs still water. Likewise, software can exist as source code or executable code ‚Äì it‚Äôs still software. We use water in one of its three states depending on whether we want to wash a car (liquid), cool a drink (ice), or clean a carpet (steam).</p>

<p>In the world of software, executable code is difficult for humans to read, but easily executed by computers. Source code is easily read and modified by humans, but computers cannot execute it. Source code must be compiled or interpreted before a computer can execute it.</p>

<h3>One Way Translation</h3>

<p>Translating source code into executable code is a one-way street. Once a programmer has compiled source code into executable code, it is virtually impossible to convert it back into source code. You might think of a compiler as a blender that chops the food into a form easily digestible by the computer. After it‚Äôs chopped, the food never returns to its original form.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why programmers always keep a copy of the source code handy. It might be necessary to make changes (fix bugs) and re-compile.</p>

<p>Trade secrets that are hidden in executable code can be easily read in source code. So developers go to great lengths to protect their source code, except in the open source community.</p>

<h3>Closed Source Tradition</h3>

<p>Most of today‚Äôs business software is closed source. Two examples: Microsoft Office and Apple iWork. Both Microsoft and Apple consider the source code for their respective office suites to be highly confidential. You will never (legally) download the source code for a closed source product. Security is so tight at Microsoft, for example, that engineers are only allowed to view that portion of the source code that is relevant to their current project.</p>

<p>Contrast that against open source software. Open source products make the source code freely available for viewing, comments, and modification by the software community at large.</p>

<h3>Open Source Chaos?</h3>

<p>But doesn&rsquo;t such openness lead to chaos? Intuitively, you would think so, but it doesn&rsquo;t. The culture of the open source community has its own rules of conduct that most members willingly follow. Rules are enforced by the community in ways that developers respond to.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine an apparently chaotic system that produces robust software. How counter-intuitive! But a long list of successful open source projects (available through your favorite search engine) shows that the method works. Eric S. Raymond explores open source cultural norms in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B0026OR3LM">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.</p>

<h3>The Banking Metaphor</h3>

<p>Some makers of security software believe that hiding their source code will prevent malcontents from finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them. Their reasoning is like that of a bank owner who keeps the building blueprints secret so thieves don‚Äôt know how to drill the safe from next door.</p>

<p>Other security experts disagree. They want many people (including malcontents) to view the code so that vulnerabilities can be discovered and patched early. Their philosophy could be summed up in a statement by the creator of Linux:</p>

<blockquote><p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
<br/>&nbsp;
~Linus Torvalds</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, when thousands of developers are working on the same project they are likely to be widely dispersed across the code. Wide coverage means that a given bug is more likely to be discovered by at least one developer.</p>

<p>In our banking metaphor, the open source company would be like a bank owner who wants many people to review the blueprints, find the weak spots, and fix security holes before the bank gets robbed.</p>

<h3>It‚Äôs Not All-or-Nothing</h3>

<p>Choosing an open or closed source strategy is not an all-or-nothing decision. Google, the busiest search engine on the web, has bet the company on open source software. And yet their most strategic software, the secret mathematical engine that drives their search results, remains closed. So how does a company decide what to open and what to close?</p>

<p>Open source works when the upside of sharing outweighs the downside of exposed code. In the Google example, using and contributing to Linux gives Google a very stable operating platform at a relatively low cost. In effect they are leveraging the time and talent of thousands of developers around the world, while those developers are also leveraging Google‚Äôs expertise.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that Google&rsquo;s competitors also benefit from that same stable Linux platform because Google differentiates itself through advanced search technology. By leveraging the community for assistance with the platform (Linux, Apache, and other tools), Google frees up engineering time and talent to focus on their secret sauce: Search methodology and mathematics.</p>

<h3>If Your Business Isn‚Äôt Software</h3>

<p>So&hellip; If you don&rsquo;t run a software company, how can you benefit from open source?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs always a chance that open source won‚Äôt work for your company. Maybe you run an enterprise that doesn‚Äôt benefit from the web. In that case, your current software options may suit you just fine.</p>

<p>Of course, you may have already benefited from open source. There is at least a 70% chance that your company‚Äôs web site runs on Linux. If that‚Äôs the case, then rest assured that you‚Äôre running on a very stable and robust platform.</p>

<h3>Think Big, Start Small for ROI</h3>

<p>If you really want to see ROI from open source, encourage your technical team (software developers, network support, etc.) to explore open source tools. Chances are that they‚Äôve already experimented with open source and they‚Äôre waiting for an opportunity to do an official company project.</p>

<p>Start small, perhaps with an automated network monitoring project or a small database. As you explore the technology, new ideas will become apparent to you. View this as a way to accelerate and strengthen the software development process.</p>

<h3>Open Source and Automobiles</h3>

<p>BMW is arguably the best automotive engineering company on the planet. Does BMW invent the wheel every time they design a new automobile? Absolutely not. BMW leverages thousands of years of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; wheel technology, and they focus their design energy in areas where they can make a difference: Engine, transmission, suspension, and luxury amenities. A similar model can be applied to software development. In fact, it already has.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-17T14:46:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/17/sgi-and-big-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/sgi-logo-1990s.png' width='' height='' alt='SGI's logo from the 1990s.' title='SGI's logo from the 1990s.'><span class='caption-text'>SGI&rsquo;s logo from the 1990s.</span></span>
<a href="http://sgi.com">Silicon Graphics International Corporation (SGI)</a> computers rendered the special effects for the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a> movie. Computer enthusiasts coveted SGI machines throughout the 1990s.</p>

<p>But success in the computer industry is fleeting. A few years after Jurassic Park, a convergence of tech advances (Moore&rsquo;s Law, x86 architecture, and Linux) made it possible for commodity PCs to perform as well as SGI&rsquo;s premium workstations. Wall Street traders and other power users abandoned workstations in favor of Linux-based PCs. High-end makers like SGI fell on hard times.</p>

<p>Today, SGI is fighting back. The company is blending x86, Linux, and (buzzword alert) big data to attack the high performance computing market. The vision was presented at this month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/163287562/">Chicago ACM</a> meeting by Brian Freed, VP of Strategy for SGI.</p>

<h3>What is Big Data?</h3>

<p>Freed shared a definition of big data from <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/01/what-is-big-data.html">Edd Dumbill&rsquo;s O&#8217;Reilly Radar article</a>. Big data is characterized by volume (lots of it), variety (it&rsquo;s unstructured), and velocity (the data changes quickly).</p>

<p>In the words of the O&#8217;Reilly author&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Big data is data that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems. The data is too big, moves too fast, or doesn‚Äôt fit the strictures of your database architectures. To gain value from this data, you must choose an alternative way to process it.</p>

<p>~Edd Dumbill</p></blockquote>

<p>Definitions are fine, but it&rsquo;s more important to understand <em>why</em> a company might care about big data. Here are a few examples that Freed shared during the ACM meeting.</p>

<h3>Example: Fraud Detection with Big Data</h3>

<p>Consider one challenge faced by credit card companies. When a credit card is presented for an online purchase, how does the authorizing body know if the charge is legitimate? Can legitimacy be determined in a timely fashion, before an impatient buyer abandons a slow seller for a quicker seller?</p>

<p>Sellers who decide too quickly will suffer fraud. Sellers who decide too slowly will lose customers. The problem is amplified because millions of shoppers are clicking the &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; button simultaneously, and they all expect an answer <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>Traditional fraud detection systems could measure just a few potential fraud criteria within the allowed time window. SGI solves the problem with <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop clusters</a> running on SGI hardware. This big data design is able to examine each transaction deeper, and render a yes/no decision faster. Buyers are happier because they can complete a purchase faster. Companies are happier because fraud is reduced.</p>

<p>Big data helps credit card companies to make better authorization decisions in less time.</p>

<h3>Example: Auto Manufacturing</h3>

<p>Some problems, like credit authorization, require a quick response.  Other problems, like manufacturing, require the problem solver to crunch large volumes of data.</p>

<p>Consider an auto manufacturer. Every system in the modern automobile is controlled by software on silicon. Where software runs, data can be collected. The data piles up rapidly over time.</p>

<p>Manufacturers have discovered some unexpected benefits of collecting so much data. For example, they can identify trends like common failures among components, and use that data to improve future components. They can spot hidden trends, like geographic issues related to extreme cold or heat, and then design parts that are specially equipped for the target environment.</p>

<p>For these particular manufacturing examples, handling huge volumes of data is more important than delivering a quick answer. Insights that lead to quality improvements can be delivered in hours, and that&rsquo;s fast enough for the designers. Before big data, many design decisions were driven by instinct and experience alone. Big data helps auto companies to make more informed decisions.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls of Big Data</h3>

<p>One big pitfall is trying to use the big data <em>hammer</em> for every <em>nail</em> in sight, whether the solution fits the problem or not. It&rsquo;s the same hazard we face with any new technology. We run the risk of using a sledgehammer when a fly swatter would do.</p>

<p>A few ways to avoid the pitfalls: Start small. Have goals. And, like any good agile software developer, iterate. In Freed&rsquo;s words&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Successful implementation of big data is not an event. It is an iterative process where we continuously learn over time.</p></blockquote>

<h3>About Chicago ACM</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/">The Chicago Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (Chicago ACM)</a> is on fire. December&rsquo;s meeting featured a supercomputing presentation by <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/12/12/high-performance-computing-at-acm/">Sharan Kalwani of Fermilab</a>. The February meeting was all about SGI&rsquo;s push into big data, and next month will focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). The organizers are assembling an exciting combination of events. Looking forward to more!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-12T14:20:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spend enough time developing software on Mac OS X, and you will eventually need to install libraries that were written for Unix, but not specifically for OS X. Fortunately we have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, which makes it easier to install Unix libraries on the Mac.</p>

<h3>Why Homebrew?</h3>

<p>Before installing any new software, it is helpful to have a clear view of <em>why</em> we need it.</p>

<p>Homebrew is a package manager. It differs from earlier package managers like <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> because it is written in Ruby and based on Git. The Ruby/Git foundation means that developers from around the planet can easily contribute to Homebrew&rsquo;s growth.</p>

<p>Before package managers, developers who needed a particular library would have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manually download source code for the library.</li>
<li>Manually compile using <code>gcc</code> or another compiler.</li>
<li>Resolve dependencies manually.</li>
</ul>


<p>Manually, manually, manually&hellip; The old way was long and error-prone. <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl">Max Howell</a> created Homebrew to download, compile, and resolve dependencies automatically. Now developers can focus more attention on solving problems that are directly related to their work.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>How to Install Homebrew</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/xcode-app-store.png' width='' height='' alt='Homebrew depends on Xcode.' title='Homebrew depends on Xcode.'><span class='caption-text'>Homebrew depends on Xcode.</span></span>
Some parts of Homebrew require Xcode, Apple&rsquo;s environment for developing software on Mac OS X. Make sure you have Xcode installed on your Mac. Xcode is available for free in the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>With Xcode installed, you can install Homebrew by pasting the following
command into a terminal window.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;</span>install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The script will walk you through the installation process. If you would like to read the script before installation, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew">Homebrew repo on Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing Packages</h3>

<p>A list of <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula">available Homebrew packages</a> is maintained on GitHub.</p>

<p>To install a package, say <code>imagemagick</code> for example&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install imagemagick
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before Homebrew, installing <code>imagemagick</code> was long and arduous. With Homebrew, the installation and compilation steps still take awhile. But dependencies are resolved by Homebrew, and little user interaction is required after the first step.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Homebrew</h3>

<p>Developers from around the world contribute to Homebrew, so the tool gets improved often. To check the health of your Homebrew installation, use <code>brew doctor</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
</span><span class='line'>You haven<span class="err">&#39;</span>t updated <span class="k">for </span>at least 24 hours, this is a long <span class="nb">time </span>in brewland!
</span><span class='line'>To update Homebrew, run <span class="sb">`</span>brew update<span class="sb">`</span>.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>brew update</code> will apply recent updates.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew update
</span><span class='line'>Updated Homebrew from f83642fc to cfad513e.

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Looking at Packages</h3>

<p>There are several ways to view the packages that have been installed on a system via Homebrew. Use <code>brew list</code> at the command prompt to get a quick view of what Homebrew has installed.</p>

<p>Even better: <code>brew server</code> will launch a local <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> app, and then you can point a browser to <code>http://localhost:4567</code> for a web-enabled view of the installed packages.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Making Your Own Packages</h3>

<p>Homebrew is Ruby-based, so Rubyists can create their own packages.  Details can be found in the (continuously updated) <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/">Homebrew repo on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://RayHightower.com/images/rubinius.png">
<a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> is an implementation of the Ruby language designed for concurrency. The lead developer of Rubinius, <a href="http://twitter.com/brixen">Brian Shirai</a>, will present Rubinius at ChicagoRuby on March 4, 2014. ChicagoRuby will follow-up with a Rubinius-themed hack night on March 12th. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/114749352/">Details</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for the Rubinius events, some people may choose to install Rubinius locally. RVM makes the process smooth.</p>

<h3>RVM Recap</h3>

<p><a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is an awesome tool that enables developers to:</p>

<ul>
<li>install multiple versions of Ruby on one system,</li>
<li>bounce between the different versions, and</li>
<li>to do all of that with minimal headaches.</li>
</ul>


<p>Similar tools exist, but RVM is the one that has always worked for me.  If you don&rsquo;t have RVM installed, detailed installation instructions can be found at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.</p>

<h3>Get the Latest RVM</h3>

<p>These instructions work on Mac OS X v10.8.5. The same steps will probably work on Linux, except for the references to Homebrew.</p>

<p>First, make sure you&rsquo;re running the latest version of RVM.</p>

<h3>Next, Install Rubinius</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Rubinius can operate in 1.8 language mode (the default) or 1.9 language mode. Installing in 1.9 mode requires an additional command line flag, shown below.</p>

<h3>Post Installation Notes</h3>

<p>The installation script found two outdated Homebrew-installed packages on my system: <code>automake</code> and <code>openssl</code>. It would have been better for me to upgrade Homebrew and related packages <em>before</em> installing Rubinius.</p>

<p>Why install Rubinius? Why do we care about concurrency? These are two questions I expect to explore through my new Rubinius installation.</p>

<h3>Come Hack With Rubinius</h3>

<p>If March 2014 finds you in the Chicago area, you&rsquo;re invited to visit ChicagoRuby for some back-to-back Rubinius action. See <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/114749352/">http://meetup.com/chicagoruby</a> for details.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who offered feedback on <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/21/an-environment-of-respect/">An Environment of Respect</a>, which included an early draft of the WindyCityRails Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>The frank and earnest exchange of ideas was educational. Some of the feedback was positive, on the order of &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all colleagues, we treat each other with respect, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, I paid special attention to the negative feedback because it surprised me. Surprise happens when I face something that I do not understand. When I encounter something that I do not understand, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for learning.</p>

<p>So I did what I always do when I need to learn more. I spoke with people who know more than me.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Wise Counsel</h3>

<p>Several people in our industry were generous when I asked for advice. One technology veteran summed it up this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>You wrote a code of conduct for an Environment of Respect. 99.9% of the people will know what that means, and they can even function well without a code. But a code of conduct needs to written for an Environment of Hostility&hellip; for the one fool who doesn&rsquo;t know how to act.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a discussion about reducing bureaucracy, one developer offered this view:</p>

<blockquote><p>Think of it less as bureaucracy and more along the lines of ‚ÄúIn case of emergency, break glass and help is on the way.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<p>I am grateful to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts.</p>

<h3>Verbose and Draconian? Not Here.</h3>

<p>Some of the advice seemed to point toward a more verbose and draconian code of conduct, like the ones suggested by a few people last week. Not good. If we have a code, it&rsquo;s better to avoid the threatening tone. WindyCityRails is a community of colleagues who treat each other with respect.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one member of our team found a code that works. Every member of the community is treated like an independent-thinking adult who respects the rights of others. Expectations are clear, and the threatening tone is gone.</p>

<h3>Ruby DCamp: Thanks</h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/elight">Evan Light</a> wrote the original version of this code of conduct for <a href="http://rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a>. When asked for permission to use his work for WindyCityRails, Evan responded with an enthusiastic <em>yes</em>. Thanks Evan!</p>

<p>Here it is.</p>

<h3>Draft: Code of Conduct</h3>

<h4>Preface</h4>

<p>WindyCityRails is and has been an event made up of welcoming, tolerant, compassionate, and loving participants. For several years now, WindyCityRails participants have been respectful of one another in our differences. We have employed those differences to elevate, educate, and celebrate one another at WindyCityRails.</p>

<p>It is in that same spirit that we now adopt this Code of Conduct: Not as a punitive action, but as a measure to protect that which we already have and to signal to all that we are a tolerant and loving community.</p>

<h4>WindyCityRails Code of Conduct</h4>

<p>WindyCityRails is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. WindyCityRails participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the event organizers&#8217; discretion. This applies to all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and otherwise.</p>

<p>That said, silliness, mockery, and general irreverence are welcome, expected, and even encouraged so long as they all come from a loving place.</p>

<p>However, should another participant&rsquo;s behavior be injurious to you, we ask three things.</p>

<h4>1) Give others the benefit of the doubt.</h4>

<p>People are generally decent. It has been our experience, these past several years, that those who attend WindyCityRails are just a cut above in that respect.</p>

<h4>2) Attempt to address the behavior with the other party immediately.</h4>

<p>In the case of intractable situations, we are here to help you (see &ldquo;Ask for Help!&rdquo; below). However, this is where we ask participants to try to behave &ldquo;like grown ups.&rdquo; It is part of the WindyCityRails ethos: If you have a problem with something, don&rsquo;t wait for someone to fix it but instead try to fix it yourself.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre comfortable doing so, let the person know that you found what he or she said or did inappropriate. Attempt to resolve the situation amicably. When addressing it yourself, remember to continue to treat the other party with kindness and respect.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable approaching the other person‚Ä¶</p>

<h4>3) Ask for Help!</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re all human. While life, and WindyCityRails, expects a good deal of self-sufficiency, we are also a community. If you cannot manage a situation alone, we are here for you. Seek out any member of the conference organizer team. We can be identified with special &ldquo;Organizer&rdquo; lanyards.</p>

<p>~WindyCityRails Organizers Team</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Thanks for reading this through. See you at <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>!</p>

    <updated>2014-01-21T13:16:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/21/an-environment-of-respect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is an early draft of the <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> Code of Conduct:</p>

<blockquote><p>WindyCityRails strives to provide a healthy, harassment-free conference experience for all attendees. Our Code of Conduct, which has been practiced by members of our community for years, is as follows: Treat everyone at the conference as you would want yourself, a family member, or an esteemed colleague to be treated. Our community is stronger when every member contributes to the safety and learning of the other members. We are colleagues, and we treat each other with respect.</p></blockquote>

<p>There may be some wordsmithing and typo-correction this week, but the final version will essentially read as it appears above. Key objectives achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity. The point is made with minimal words.</li>
<li>Inclusiveness. Everybody who wants to learn and engage is included.</li>
<li>Respect. Everybody is treated with respect. No threats are made.</li>
</ul>


<p>You have already read the most important part of this post. The rest tells how the code came to be.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>First Person Singular</h3>

<p>Normally, when discussing WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby, I shine the light on the organizers as a team (we) rather than on myself. WindyCityRails is blessed with a great team of organizers. We pool our talents to get things done.</p>

<p>However, when concerns are raised, the buck stops with the team leader: me. Please forgive me for using first person pronouns throughout this post. Also, other members of the organizer team may have opinions that differ from mine. If I say anything here that disturbs you, please know that it comes from me directly. I am the only one at fault.</p>

<h3>My Knee-Jerk Response</h3>

<p>Last week a Twitter user asked if WindyCityRails had a code of conduct. I responded (through the @WindyCityRails handle) with a one-word answer: No.</p>

<p>Why the terse response? Because I have a deep bias against bureaucracy. Initially, that&rsquo;s what a code of conduct sounded like to me. Do we have a problem with diversity in the tech community? Hell yes. But bureaucracy does not solve problems. We will only solve the diversity problem through active engagement and real work. We solve the diversity problem by ensuring that people from all groups feel welcome and engaged.</p>

<p>One example of real work: The <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/youth/">WindyCityRails Youth Program</a>, launched last year. A diverse group of college students taught a diverse group of high school students how to program the Arduino. These students from diverse backgrounds bonded via their common interest in technology.</p>

<p>To summarize my knee-jerk response: A code of conduct makes us feel good about nice words written on a sheet of paper, while no real work gets done.</p>

<h3>After My Initial Reaction</h3>

<p>Kindergarten taught me that it is important for me to listen to others. A community thrives on interaction between people who see things differently. If everyone thinks the same way, we don&rsquo;t have diversity, do we?</p>

<p>Other inquiries about a code of conduct followed via Twitter and email. All were helpful. Some people offered sample text from other events. Most of the sample text was good.</p>

<p>Two of my fellow organizers (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a>) encouraged me to examine the question more closely. Clearly, I needed to study this. So that is how I have spent the last few days.</p>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>In drafting text for WindyCityRails (and, by extension, ChicagoRuby) I tried to create something that fits our culture. We are an inclusive group and we treat people well.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is important to keep the word count low to limit bureaucracy.</p>

<h3>Inclusiveness</h3>

<p>The WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby communities have always strived to be inclusive. We do that in several ways.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Before I became an organizer of ChicagoRuby, I heard that a group of developers met for drinks after every meeting. I always heard about the gathering after the fact. I could have taken this personally, but I realized that the group was not intentionally excluding me. They just didn&rsquo;t know me. Further, they were so caught up in their discussions that it simply never occurred to them to invite people they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Things are different today. Today we announce the drink invitation at the beginning of each meeting, and we post it with every meeting announcement. Brand new people are made to feel welcome.</p>

<p>Further, we make it clear that one does not have to drink alcohol to participate. Soft drinks and cranberry juice are in abundance.</p>

<p>Another example of inclusiveness: All of ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s monthly events are free because we want to include aspiring developers regardless of income. Expenses for the monthly events are covered by monthly sponsors and revenue from WindyCityRails.</p>

<h3>Excluding Others</h3>

<p>I have more experience with racism than any other -ism, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll talk about here. A mentor of mine raised two questions during a discussion about racism and oppression.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you want to end all oppression, or just the oppression directed at you?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you really want to end oppression, or do you simply want to change places with your oppressor?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an experience that influences my thoughts on this subject. A few decades ago, when I was a young developer for a company in Colorado, I had a confrontation with senior developer, a White man. I was certain that this was a Black/White issue. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but I will admit that I treated that White man very badly in retaliation.</p>

<p>Some days later, as I walked past my manager&rsquo;s desk, I noticed my &ldquo;nemesis&rdquo; interacting with my manager (a White man who also happened to be his manager) in the same manner that he had interacted with me. That&rsquo;s when I figured out that this guy wasn&rsquo;t a racist, he was just an asshole.</p>

<p>And, because of the way I had treated him, I was the one guilty of racism.</p>

<p>In drafting the WindyCityRails code of conduct, it was important to avoid showing favoritism toward any group. All groups must be treated with respect, not just my own.</p>

<h3>Respect</h3>

<p>I was disturbed by the language in some of the sample codes of conduct. It took me awhile to figure out what bothered me. Finally, it hit me: The tone was threatening. They seemed to say (paraphrased): &ldquo;Follow these rules or we will kick you out and take away your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colleagues don&rsquo;t threaten each other. Colleagues treat each other with respect.</p>

<p>Some may point out that without a method of enforcement, the code has no teeth. They&rsquo;re right. There are no teeth. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; or threats are needed amongst colleagues. Colleagues treat each other with respect.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There you have it&hellip; my opinion. Can my opinion change? Perhaps. I have many blind spots, and that is why I am sharing my thought process. I look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments below or over a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails call for proposals</a> is still open, as of the date of this post. If you are doing something exciting with Ruby and/or Rails, please submit a proposal. Thanks.</p>

<h3><em>Update (Jan 2014)</em></h3>

<p><em>After this post, several colleagues introduced me to new information.  The result, an updated code of conduct, is covered in <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration/">An Environment of Respect, 2nd Iteration</a>.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a faster horse.</p>

<p>~Henry Ford</p></blockquote>

<p>The above Henry Ford quote is often cited in presentations about innovation. The point of the quote: An inventor who listens to customers too closely, without observing customer behavior, will reap tiny improvements at best. Ford ignored the request for &ldquo;a faster horse&rdquo;, and that is how the Ford Motor Company became a leader in the early auto industry.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one way to interpret Ford&rsquo;s quote. Last night, I was introduced to another view.</p>

<h3>Parse the Quote Differently, Don&rsquo;t Ignore it</h3>

<p>Last night&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ixdachicago.org">IxDA Chicago</a> meeting featured a presentation by <a href="http://chris-holmes.com">Chris Holmes</a>, who shared a different view of the Ford quote. If we focus on improving the speed of horses (perhaps through nutrition or better horse shoes) very little improvement can be achived.</p>

<p>But something interesting happens when we parse the quote differently. The adjective <em>faster</em> reveals the customer&rsquo;s true need. The noun <em>horse</em> is the customer&rsquo;s &ldquo;solution&rdquo; based on what they currently know about the world. For the innovator, <em>faster</em> stands out. Focusing on <em>faster</em> leads to innovation.</p>

<h3>Focus on Faster</h3>

<p><em>Faster</em> tells us that we can stretch beyond our current thinking and consider other modes of transportation. Focusing on <em>faster</em> led to the beginning of the automobile industry.</p>

<p>Customers are communicating their desires all the time. We need to listen carefully and parse well. Thanks IxDA Chicago and Chris Holmes for the lesson.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/06/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/ruby-rails-ubuntu-beaglebone-black.png' width='' height='' alt='Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.' title='Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.'><span class='caption-text'>Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.</span></span></p>

<p>Part one of this series shows <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black</a>. We used a MacBook Pro to burn an Ubuntu disk image onto an SD card, and then we booted a BeagleBone Black from the image we created.</p>

<p>This post, part two, covers the installation of the Ubuntu GUI, Ruby, and Rails. All of the commands in this article are run on the BeagleBone Black.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> bonus: Rails requires a JavaScript runtime, and Node.js offered the quickest way to fulfill this requirement. Details appear within.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Partition Size</h3>

<p>At the end of <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">part one</a>, we successfully booted the Bone with the Ubuntu command line interface. Now it&rsquo;s time to add the GUI. Two things to know about the Ubuntu GUI installation&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The partition we created on the SD card (in part one) is too small to hold the Ubuntu GUI. Solution: The SD card has some extra room, and we can re-size the partition.</li>
<li>We can install the Ubuntu GUI with a single line command. But it takes an hour for the Bone to download, compile, and install all of the GUI libraries.</li>
</ul>


<p>If we try to install the GUI with insufficient space, the installation will fail midway and we will have wasted half an hour. So it&rsquo;s best to re-size first.</p>

<h3>Doing Our Own Re-Sizing?</h3>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the partition have the right size when we originally downloaded the image file? Good question.</p>

<p>My guess: The image file was designed to be as small as possible in order to minimize download time. That makes sense. I plan to test this theory by creating a new image with a larger partition size and a pre-installed GUI. If the test is successful, results will be posted on this blog. If the mission fails, then the secretary will disavow any knowledge&hellip;</p>

<h3>How to Re-Size the Partition</h3>

<p><code>df</code> is the Unix &lsquo;disk free&rsquo; command. It shows used/available disk space.</p>

<p><code>fdisk</code> will resize the partition we&rsquo;re after. <code>root</code> priviledges are required to modify the partition table, so we&rsquo;ll use <code>sudo</code>. The standard <a href="http://RayHightower.com/sudo-disclaimer">sudo disclaimer</a> applies.</p>

<p>A few useful <code>fdisk</code> commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>p</code> prints the partition table.</li>
<li><code>d</code> deletes a partition.</li>
<li><code>n</code> creates a new partition.</li>
<li><code>w</code> write new information to the partition table.</li>
<li><code>q</code> quits fdisk.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the plan: In order to increase the size of <code>/dev/mmcblk0p2</code>, we will delete it, and then re-create it with a larger size. Note the use of the <code>d</code> and <code>n</code> commands in the following sequence. When <code>fdisk</code> asks us for the new partition number, type, first sector, and last sector, we will choose the defaults. Choosing the defaults will use all of the available space on the SD card.</p>

<p>Your numbers will vary depending on the size and configuration of your SD card, but the general procedure will be the same.</p>

<p>The warning/error message at the end just means that we need reboot the Bone before the partition table takes effect.</p>

<p>Reboot the BeagleBone Black, holding down the boot switch (closest to
the USB port) to ensure that we boot to the system on the SD card
instead of the eMMC.</p>

<p>After the Bone reboots, run <code>resize2fs</code> to expand the partition created above.</p>

<p>And now we have enough room to install the Ubuntu GUI.</p>

<h3>Installing the Ubuntu GUI</h3>

<p><em>Update (Feb2014): In the comments below, Jonathan Chan describes how he updated the desktop installation files before installing the Ubuntu desktop. You can update the desktop installation files with&hellip;</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the partition on the SD card has been resized, this command will intall the GUI. The command is short, but the process takes about an hour:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When installation and compilation are complete, Ubuntu will return to the command prompt. Here&rsquo;s how to reboot:</p>

<p>Several minutes later, the Ubuntu 12 GUI will appear. Congratulations!  Login using the default credentials (login: ubuntu, pw: ubuntu) to get to the Ubuntu desktop.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Running RVM</h3>

<p>I prefer to use the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) for bouncing between Ruby versions. RVM misbehaved, initially. Then I learned something special about RVM&rsquo;s interaction with Ubuntu. From the RVM support pages‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote><p>For RVM to work properly, you have to set the &lsquo;Run command as login shell&rsquo; checkbox on the Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal&rsquo;s Settings page.</p></blockquote>

<p>This image shows the checkbox mentioned in the quote. It&rsquo;s inside of the lower red rectangle.</p>

<p>Details are in the RVM support article <a href="http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal">Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Ruby Installation</h3>

<p>Ruby installation initially failed (speculation) because the Bone went into power save mode during the installation process. Ruby installed successfully on the second try when I kept the machine awake by moving the mouse. This <em>power save hypothesis</em> has not been thoroughly tested.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Rails Installation</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/nodejs-white.png' width='' height='' alt='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.' title='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.'><span class='caption-text'>Node.js on BeagleBone Black.</span></span>
Rails needs a JavaScript runtime in order to function. Here are two ways to meet this requirement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Node.js, or</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/therubyracer">therubyracer</a> gem.</li>
</ul>


<p>Installing <code>therubyracer</code> did not work for me. But Node.js installed quickly, like so:</p>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install nodejs
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that we have a JavaScript runtime, Rails runs successfully.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Bottom line: Ruby, Rails, and Ubuntu can run successfully on BeagleBone Black, with Node.js as a bonus.</p>

<p>The BeagleBone Black is a cool option for running Ubuntu. Yes, it runs slower than a typical laptop. But it runs, and at $45 each we can build a cluster of Bones if we&rsquo;re concerned about performance!</p>

<p>What an amazing bundle of technology.</p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, and Rails. Why Ubuntu? The Bone comes <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">pre-installed with √Öngstr√∂m</a>, and it boots as soon as you unbox it. Why not stick with √Öngstr√∂m?</p>

<p>My opinion: The factory standard is fine, but it&rsquo;s always good to have options. Here&rsquo;s why I decided to try Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Ubuntu documentation is plentiful. Books, blogs, and videos are readily available.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu community is huge. When a dev runs into an Ubuntu-related snag, it&rsquo;s likely that another dev has encountered a similar problem, and they can collaborate on a solution.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the distro that I&rsquo;m most familiar with. <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> uses Ubuntu for multiple projects. With a common operating system, knowledge gained in one environment is immediately useful in another.</li>
<li>Prepping for <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a>, the 64-core single-board computer that will cost about two hundred bucks. The Parallella is currently in short supply. When it becomes available, it will run Ubuntu. Experience with other single-board computers, especially those running Ubuntu, will prove useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>This article will show how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black. <em>Gotchas</em> will be pointed out along the way. Where possible, I will explain the reasons behind my decisions so that you can make different choices if you like.</p>

<p>For a comparable examination of the Raspberry Pi, take a look at <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Ruby on Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<h3>First Gotcha: Ubuntu 13 on the Bone</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 12 runs well on the BeagleBone Black, but Ubuntu 13 does not. My Ubuntu 13 installation appeared to be successful, but the Ubuntu 13 GUI hung up immediately after login. The Ubuntu 13 command line interface worked fine.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google reveals that others encountered similar roadblocks with version 13. One successful Bone/13 installation was used via SSH, not interactively via keyboard and GUI. Hopefully this will change with future updates. Or, since we&rsquo;re dealing in the open source world, maybe I can pitch in and help.</p>

<p>Due to the issues encountered with version 13, everything in this article will focus on Ubuntu 12.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Installing Ubuntu 12</h3>

<p>In addition to the BeagleBone Black, the following items should be gathered before installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro SD card of at least 8GB. It&rsquo;s possible to perform the installation with a 4GB card, but that won&rsquo;t leave much room for Ubuntu applications.</li>
<li>SD card reader/writer. Recent versions of Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro come with an SD reader/writer built in.</li>
<li>SD to Micro-SD card adapter. The Bone is designed for micro SD, and the MacBook Pro is designed for full-sized SD. Some micro SD packages come with the adapter.</li>
<li>A monitor that accepts HDMI input.</li>
<li>USB keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter. The Bone uses micro HDMI for video output, but your monitor probably uses full-sized HDMI.</li>
<li>External 5V power adapter for the Bone. Personally, I trust the standard 5v power input more than I trust the power provided via USB. One never knows if USB can provide sufficient (and stable) amperage for a circuit board. Power fluctuations can lead to strange behavior, including video flickering.</li>
<li>Ethernet cable with RJ-45 ends.</li>
<li>A fast internet connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>The standard <a href="http://RayHightower.com/sudo-disclaimer">sudo disclaimer</a> applies.</p>

<h3>Homebrew Required</h3>

<p>Homebrew is the easiest way to install &lsquo;nix utilities on Mac OS X. We need Homebrew in order to install some of the utilities needed to burn the SD card. The one-line Homebrew installation command is given on the  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew site</a>.</p>

<p>Each time we use Homebrew, we run <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> to make sure the packages are up-to-date.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The xz Extraction Utility</h3>

<p>Disk image files are downloaded in a compressed format. We need the <code>xz</code> utility in order to extract the files into something usable. If you already have Homebrew installed, this command will install <code>xz</code> for you.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install xz
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Test the BeagleBone Black First</h3>

<p>Power up your BeagleBone Black and make sure it runs with the built-in √Öngstr√∂m Linux installation. One great thing about the Bone is that it will <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">boot to the √Öngstr√∂m GUI</a> straight out of the box, with no prior configuration.</p>

<p>If the GUI boots, then you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>If the GUI doesn&rsquo;t boot, it may have been damaged in a prior experiement. Embarassing note: I started looking for a way to install Ubuntu on the Bone because I broke my √Öngstr√∂m installation. What can I say&hellip; I learn more from destructive experiments. Faced with a non-booting Bone, I had two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-build √Öngstr√∂m.</li>
<li>Try something different, like Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Option two worked well!</p>

<h3>Prep the SD Card</h3>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility is a convenient tool for wiping the SD card.  Standard warnings about any disk utility apply. Double-check everything, and make sure you&rsquo;re wiping the right volume, or you could lose all of your data.</p>

<p>Next, download the Ubuntu 12.04 image from <a href="http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/#precise">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the image using the <code>xz</code> utility.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>xz ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The extracted image will have a <code>.img</code> file extension. We will use the <code>dd</code> utility to burn the disk image to the SD card. But first, we need to determine the designation of the SD card.</p>

<h3>Find the SD Card Designation</h3>

<p>In order to burn the SD card, we need to make sure we target it correctly. Here&rsquo;s how to figure out which device to target.</p>

<p><code>$ diskutil list</code> will show all of the partitions mounted on the system.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>diskutil list
</span><span class='line'>/dev/disk0
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c">#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER</span>

</span><span class='line'>   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
</span><span class='line'>   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
</span><span class='line'>   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
</span><span class='line'>/dev/disk1
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c">#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER</span>
</span><span class='line'>   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I happen to know that my SD Card is 8.0 GB in capacity, and my system also has a 500 GB SSD. The goal is to burn the SD card while leaving the 500 GB SSD (home of the Mac OS X operating system and all of my data) intact. From the <code>$ diskutil list</code> report, I can see that the SD card&rsquo;s designation <em>in my system</em> is <code>/dev/disk1</code>.</p>

<p>Note the italicized words <em>in my system</em>. Your system is probably different, especially if you have a DVD drive or a second hard drive. I have neither of those. The SD card&rsquo;s designation will be different in each system where it is mounted depending on the number and location of the drives that are already there.</p>

<p>Now that we know the SD card&rsquo;s designation, we can unmount it. We unmount the drive (but leave the card inserted in the reader) so that it can be written with the Ubuntu disk image.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
</span><span class='line'>Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looks like the SD card was unmounted successfully. Now we can write the
Ubuntu image with the <code>dd</code> utility.</p>

<h3>Writing the Ubuntu Image</h3>

<p>The following command will write the decompressed Ubuntu image to the SD
card.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo dd <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1m <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/disk1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that it may take up to an hour for the image to be written.</p>

<p>One drawback of using the command line is that there is no gauge to tell you how much progress the utility is making. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a way to measure progress at <a href="http://elinux.org">eLinux.org</a>. While the command line utility is running, and while that window has focus, type <code>control-T</code>. A few seconds later, the terminal window will show a brief activity report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a report from the first time I struck <code>control-T</code> &hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>load: 2.03  cmd: dd 75608 uninterruptible 0.00u 0.54s
</span><span class='line'>40+0 records in
</span><span class='line'>39+0 records out
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can strike <code>control-T</code> again to receive additional updates. The numbers will tell us if we are making progress. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with <code>control-T</code>. A watched pot never boils :&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Booting with the New SD Card</h3>

<p>The terminal will return to the command prompt after the Ubuntu image has been written to the SD card. Now it&rsquo;s time to boot with the new image.</p>

<ol>
<li>Eject the SD card from the Mac.</li>
<li>Remove power from the BeagleBone Black, and insert the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Note the location of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; button on the Bone. It&rsquo;s the micro switch closest to the USB port. We will need to hold this switch down while powering up the Bone.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few notes about item #3. It takes some juggling to hold down a micro switch while plugging in power to the board. I found it easier to plug the power adapter into a powered-off surge suppressor, hold down the microswitch, and then power-on the surge suppressor with my elbow.  Sounds ridiculous, but it worked.</p>

<p>About sixty seconds after boot, the Linux penguin appeared in the upper left corner of the Bone display. And then the login prompt appeared.</p>

<p>Another note about the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; switch: It looks like the Bone will boot into the SD&rsquo;s operating system (instead of the eMMC flash OS where Angstrom resides) without the micro switch if the switch was used in the previous boot. I haven&rsquo;t rebooted enough times to test this thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Default Credentials for Ubuntu on BeagleBone Black</h3>

<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default BeagleBone Black login credentials are shown here because I always end up hunting for these when I need them. It&rsquo;s much easier to have information at one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>login: ubuntu

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What can we build with disposable electronics? An ad in the January 2014 issue of <a href="http://wired.com">Wired Magazine</a> lets the reader change the color of a Moto X smartphone by pressing a colored circle on the page. This 20-second video shows the ad in operation followed by a glimpse of the inner workings.</p>

<h3>Inner Workings</h3>

<p>Taking the ad apart required one simple tool, a pair of scissors. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside:</p>

<ul>
<li>Four 3-volt CR2025 lithium coin batteries. This kind of battery is commonly used to power the remote key fob for an automobile. Walgreens sells these batteries.</li>
<li>One tiny circuit board, about 1-inch square. I see nine resistors, four capacitors, one diode, and one application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The designation <code>C0010-V1</code> is printed on the board. Nothing shows the board&rsquo;s manufacturer.</li>
<li>Eleven switches in one switch assembly. The switches are connected to the circuit board via seven leads.</li>
<li>Three LEDs, pointed to shine light on a 3.5&#8221; x 6.5&#8221; reflecting panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>This assembly is more expensive than a typical full-page ad, but probably not by much. Mildly amusing to play with, and fun to take apart. Yes, the advertisers succeded in grabbing my attention.</p>

<h3>Advertising ROI?</h3>

<p>A famous ad expert once remarked, &ldquo;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is I don&rsquo;t know which half.&rdquo; Is the Moto X ad useful or wasted?</p>

<p>An observation: I played with this paper gadget for a good ten minutes and I took the thing apart <em>before</em> I considered reading the ad copy. Maybe the color change is too distracting for the ad to be effective? Maybe the temptation to disassemble the ad is too distracting, too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m still talking about the ad. And blogging about it. Ultimate test: How will an ad like this influence buying behavior?</p>

<p>Beyond advertising, what else can we do with disposable electronics?</p>

<blockquote><p>Anyone can build a fast CPU. The trick is to build a fast system.
&nbsp;<br/>
~ Seymour Cray</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chicago chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href="http://www.chicagoacm.org/">Chicago ACM</a>) hosted a lecture titled <em>Supercomputing and You</em> yesterday evening. The talk was delivered by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharankalwani">Sharan Kalwani</a> of <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>. Kalwani&rsquo;s background blends mechanical engineering and computer science with decades of high performance computing experience.</p>

<h3>10x => High Performance Computing</h3>

<p>Kalwani began his talk by drawing a distinction between <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing (HPC)</em>. Supercomputing is the buzzword that everyone knows, but the word implies that the designers are focused only on improving CPU performance. Such narrow focus could cause us to ignore important subsystems. For example, if engineers focus strictly on CPU performance, applications that are CPU-bound will quickly encounter I/O bottlenecks. High performance computing takes the entire system into account: CPU, I/O, cache, memory&hellip; anything that can influence performance.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This article will use the terms <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing</em> interchangably because we are discussing the field in general. In an engineering document, the distinction would be more important.</p>

<p>By definition, supercomputers perform at least ten times faster than the current state-of-the art. The definition is a moving target. The processor in today&rsquo;s smartphone would have been considered a high performance computer a decade ago.</p>

<h3>The First Supercomputer</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cray.com/">Seymour Cray</a> is regarded as the father of the supercomputer. Cray cobbled together the first supercomputer using off-the-shelf components of the day and his unique ideas about computer architecture.</p>

<p>For example, Cray observed that the speed of an electrical signal was one bottleneck in computer performance. Electrical signals travel at the speed of light. Light can travel roughly one foot in one nanosecond.  Therefore, Cray decided that all internal cables in his new system would be less than a foot in length. No input would need to wait more than a nanosecond for a signal.</p>

<p>The 1972-era Cray supercomputer ran at a clock speed of 80MHz. It used a 64-bit word size. As a point of comparison, a 1972-era business mainframe ran at 4MHz with a 16-bit word size.</p>

<h3>Supercomputers&hellip; So What?</h3>

<p>Why do we need to spend time and money on high performance computers?  How does the general public benefit?</p>

<p>HPC enables us to solve problems that elude typical computers. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Auto safety testing</em>. Kalwani spent several years using HPC to run simulated crash tests for General Motors. A physical crash test, one in which the car is destroyed, costs $500k per car. The same test can be run in a simulator for $5k. Engineers still need to test a physical car at the end of the testing cycle, but the number of cars destroyed is drastically reduced. The business advantage of HPC-simulated tests is clear.</li>
<li><em>Nuclear testing</em>. It is very expensive (measured both in dollars and in human lives) to test a nuclear power plant. Fortunately, scientists know enough about nuclear behavior to create realistic simulations. Testing via simulation helps to manage costs and reduce accidents.</li>
<li><em>Weather forecasting</em>. The first supercomputers needed three days to predict the weather for <em>tomorrow</em>. What good is a 2-day-old weather forecast? A good forecast can save lives by telling people to evacute before a life-threatening natural disaster. Today&rsquo;s supercomputers can produce accurate weather forecasts while the reader still has time to take action.</li>
<li><em>Bioinformatics</em>. When scientists can reliably simulate drug behavior before live human testing, medical treatments can be improved and lives can be saved.</li>
<li><em>Energy exploration</em>. As long as people depend on fossil fuels, new sources need to be discovered in a timely and cost-effective way.  Supercomputers can process seismic data quickly and with sufficient granularity to tell prospectors where to drill.</li>
</ul>


<p>The bottom line: High performance computers deliver a return on investment that far outweighs their cost.</p>

<h3>Trickle Down Technology</h3>

<p>Many of the advances that we enjoy on today&rsquo;s laptops were invented by HPC architects. Kalwani shared one example: Cray invented the solid state disk (SSD) when mechanical disk drives proved to be a bottleneck. Can you imagine what an SSD must have cost in 1982 when it was invented? Today, SSDs are standard equipment on many laptops.</p>

<h3>Who Has the Fastest Supercomputer?</h3>

<p><a href="http://top500.org/">Top500.org</a> lists the fastest supercomputers on the planet, ordered by number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The race to be the fastest is highly competitive, so check the list for the latest champion.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the Top 500 list is missing a few names. Some governments or companies might not want to publicize their HPC skills.</p>

<h3>Speed vs. Power</h3>

<p>Supercomputers gulp electricity. Rule of thumb: One megawatt of electricity used over the course of one year costs $1 million. The fastest supercomputer in the world uses 17 megawatts of electricity, so its owners have an annual electric bill of $17 million dollars.</p>

<p><a href="http://green500.org">The Green 500</a> list recognizes the most energy efficient supercomputers in the world.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Paradigm</h3>

<p>Kalwani closed the historical section of his talk with a discussion of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">The Fourth Paradigm</a> of discovery. The concept comes from a collection of essays published by Microsoft Press. As of this writing, a free PDF of the book is available from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">Microsoft Research</a>.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s introduction posits that there have been four paradigms of human scientific discovery:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Empirical</em>. Started a thousand years ago. Science was all about describing natural phenomena.</li>
<li><em>Theoretical</em>. Started a few hundred years ago. Scientific understanding is achieved via models and generalizations.</li>
<li><em>Computational</em>. Started a few decades ago. Scientists seek understanding by simulating complex phenomena using computer models.</li>
<li><em>Data Exploration (eScience)</em>. Starting now. Scientists now have the technology to capture and store huge quantities of data, inexpensively and indefinitely. Software will &ldquo;look&rdquo; for trends in the data using statistical models. The software will identify trends in the data, and point them out for further investigation.</li>
</ul>


<p>One example of the Fourth Paradigm in action: Recent discoveries of sub-atomic particles were initiated by eScience. Software running on high performance computers identified trends, and the scientists followed up with deeper investigation. Discoveries followed after that.</p>

<p>Businesses have led the way in extracting trends from mountains of data. This path offered limited results for scientists because computers were too slow to handle scientific data in a timely fashion. Partial differential equations eat many CPU cycles!</p>

<p>High performance computing opens up a new universe of data insight for scientists and engineers.</p>

<h3>The Future of HPC</h3>

<p>Kalwani ended the talk by looking into his crystal ball and telling us about the future of HPC. A few trends on the horizon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Power consumption issues will dominate discussions. High performance computers are terribly inefficient. Either we need to find a free, unlimited supply of energy (unlikely) or we must design supercomputers that gulp less power.</li>
<li>GPGPUs. General purpose graphics processing units are already used for non-graphics applications, like Bitcoin mining. As more applications are discovered for the devices, faster GPGPUs will follow.</li>
<li>ARM. Advanced Risc Machine processors use less power and their performance continues to increase. Could ARM hold the key to power reduction in high performance computing?</li>
<li>Rex Parallella. Fresh from last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing Conference</a>: <a href="http://www.rexcomputing.com/">Rex Computing</a> is using <a href="http://www.parallella.org/">Parallella</a> boards to build low-energy high performance computing clusters.</li>
<li>Quantum computing. Kalwani ran out of time as he was covering this item, but he shared enough to spark my interest. He explained quantum computing by using an analogy: Quantum computing is to digital computing as digital computing is to the abacus. The degree of advancement is that dramatic. <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a> is one company exploring this area.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I encountered some interesting behavior between <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and Ruby this afternoon. I can describe what happened, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why. Perhaps another member of the dev community can shed some light.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Git 1.8.5</h3>

<p>Earlier today I learned that Git 1.8.5 was available. So I decided to upgrade. Since I use Homebrew for package management, it was time for <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> as well.</p>

<p><code>$ brew doctor</code> has spoken. Time to update Homebrew.</p>

<h3>Homebrew First. Git Later.</h3>

<p>Updating Homebrew is as simple as <code>$ brew update</code>, right?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><code>$ brew update</code> choked. Further, Homebrew said that I should report a bug. But something smelled fishy. I decided to try running Homebrew under Ruby 2.0.0 instead of Ruby 1.9.3, the default on my system. Running <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a> makes bouncing between Ruby versions a snap.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That did the trick. <code>$ brew update</code> worked fine, and <code>$ brew doctor</code>
confirmed it.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m posting this article as a note to my future self. Error messages sometimes lie. They don&rsquo;t mean to lie, but an error messsage can only give you its best guess based on what it <em>thinks</em> is happening on your system. It&rsquo;s up to the developer to sniff out the rest of the clues.</p>

<p>After decades in this industry, I&rsquo;m still learning this lesson :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode of 60 Minutes featured an interview with Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. The timing was perfect for Amazon. Black Friday was a few days ago. Cyber Monday is today. Online retailers want to be top-of-mind when people are inclined to spend money.</p>

<h3>Amazon&rsquo;s Surprise: Drones</h3>

<p>Bezos unveiled a surprise for interviewer Charlie Rose: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ref_=tsm_1_tw_s_amzn_mx3eqp&amp;node=8037720011">Amazon Prime Air</a>, a service that will deliver most Amazon products in thirty minutes or less using a fleet of octocopter drones.</p>

Octocopter drone ready for take-off.' title='Amazon Prime Air. Octocopter drone ready for take-off.'><span class='caption-text'>Amazon Prime Air. Octocopter drone ready for take-off.</span></span></p>

<h3>Guerrilla Marketing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.gmarketing.com/">Jay Conrad Levinson</a>, author of <em>Guerrilla Marketing</em>, would applaud this move by Amazon. Amazon Prime Air is two years away at the earliest. The flying drones require Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval, and that takes time. By unveiling the drones now, before approval, Amazon reaps several benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buzz. Everybody is talking about Amazon on Cyber Monday.</li>
<li>Political influence. Some of the people feeling the buzz are FAA officials.</li>
<li>Continued top-of-mind awareness. Long after Cyber Monday, the excitement of the drone idea will carry on.</li>
</ul>


<p>Congrats to the Amazon team for a well-executed Guerrilla Marketing move.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Teenagers are a tough audience. If you have ever spoken to a youth group, you know the challenge: Speak about something important without putting the youth to sleep. Tall order.</p>

<h3>Three Stories</h3>

<p>Boy Scout <a href="http://troop534.org">Troop 534 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</a> asked me to speak at the Troop‚Äôs annual reunion breakfast this year.  I approached them with three stories centered around the theme of <em>Specialized Knowledge and the Courage to Execute</em>. What a boring title! But the three stories appealed to the group. Here‚Äôs a summary of the first story:</p>

<blockquote><p>A tractor maker takes drastic action when when Enzo Ferrari (creator of the Ferrari sports car) pisses him off.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Gratitude</h3>

<p>This event was a big deal for me because I grew up in Troop 534 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;, I currently serve as one of the adult leaders, and the breakfast organizers normally invite an outsider to speak. Why listen to a speaker who you see all the time?</p>

<p>I took the speaking invitation as an opportunity to assemble some new material. Thank you scouts, parents, and leaders for having me.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Much easier to read. The structure of the <code>subviews</code> array is clear. Each element of the array has an easy-to-read index. Debugging time is reduced.</p>

<h3>How to Install awesome_print_motion</h3>

<p>RubyMotion uses bundler. So we start by refering to <code>awesome_print_motion</code> in our gemfile.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;awesome_print_motion&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the app&rsquo;s <code>Rakefile</code>, there are two possible ways to proceed. The preferred way is to use the following lines to tell the app to require every gem mentioned in Bundler&rsquo;s Gemfile:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">begin</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;bundler&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">Bundler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">require</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">LoadError</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The older way is to manually add a <code>require</code> statement to the Rakefile.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ap&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Personally, I prefer the newer way because it automatically
requires all of the gems mentioned in the <code>Gemfile</code>. The odds of a
typo-induced error are reduced.</p>

<h3>How to Use awesome_print_motion</h3>

<p>To use the new gem, start the app and explore away. Any time you want to
run output through the <code>awesome_print_motion</code> gem, send the code as a
parameter to the <code>ap</code> method like so&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">ap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">subviews</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&hellip; and the output will be easier to read.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-11T19:03:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/11/os-x-and-rubymotion-finishing-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/show-package-contents.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
There is something I neglected to cover in a previous blog post, <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/01/building-an-os-x-app-with-rubymotion/">Building an OS X App With RubyMotion</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve written the OS X app, where do you find the executable, and how do you add it to the <code>Applications</code> folder on the Mac?</p>

<p>Long-time Mac enthusiasts may already know how to do this. The information is included here for completeness.</p>

<h3>Find, Drag, and Drop</h3>

<p>First thing to note: A Mac app named [random-app].app is actually a directory, even though it appears to be a file when viewed in the <code>Applications</code> folder. If you&rsquo;re curious, right-click on any app in the <code>Applications</code> folder and choose <code>Show Package Contents</code> from the speed menu.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After compilation, RubyMotion puts all of the executables in the app&rsquo;s <code>build/</code> directory. Using Finder, drag the folder named <code>[your-app-name].app</code> into the <code>Applications</code> folder.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the command line‚Ä¶</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="o">[</span>root-directory-of-your-app<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cp build/MacOSX-10.8-Development/<span class="o">[</span>your-app-name<span class="o">]</span>.app /Applications
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether we copy the file or move it.  RubyMotion creates a new one with every build, when we type <code>rake</code>.</p>

<h3>Launch at Login</h3>

<p>I want the EjectDisks utility to be always available, so it would be good to have it launch automatically at login. That behavior is managed in the <code>Users and Groups</code> preference pane, shown below:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/launch-at-login.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span></p>

<p>Click the <code>+</code> sign, navigate to the app you want to launch at login time (in this case, EjectDisks) and select it. Done.</p>

<a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a> are three small, powerful Linux-based computers. But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.</p>

<h3>Inspiration in a Suitcase</h3>

<p>The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my <em>regular work</em> faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent time learning assembler with the HP 5036.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/hp-5036.png' width='' height='' alt='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab' title='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab'><span class='caption-text'>HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab</span></span></p>

<p>The entire 5036 fits in a suitcase&hellip; how cool is that! Here&rsquo;s how the 5036 works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing assembler-level code by hand on paper.</li>
<li>Grab the reference book for the microprocessor running on the
board, Intel 8080.</li>
<li>For each assembler-level command, find the corresponding 2-digit
hexidecimal operation code.</li>
<li>Key the op code into the 5036 by hand.</li>
<li>Run the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Working with the 5036 was addictive in a positive way. In a subsequent job, where I wrote assembler to drive hardware devices, I was ready.</p>

<h3>Portability Needed</h3>

<p>Fast forward a few decades. We now have the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella. Wonderful devices with one flaw in common: No portability. That&rsquo;s when I had a flashback to my days with the 5036.</p>

<p>I bought a $35 technician box from Home Depot and I ripped out the insides. Micro Center had 720p LCD monitors on sale for $90, so I bought one of those. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the extra bucks for a 1080p LCD because you never know how something like this might work out! Finally, I topped everything off with a $25 keyboard/trackpad combo from Amazon.  The result appears in the photo at the top of this article. Special thanks to Ericka [last name unknown] from Home Depot who gave me tons of ideas on how to securely fasten the monitor to the case.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why did I spend the time and money to assemble this kit? It&rsquo;s all about learning. Devs learn more when we interact with other devs &ndash; people who are learning some of the same things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with. And sometimes the things we need to learn are too new for books.</p>

<p>By carrying my Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella with me in a portable unit, I can share my experiences with other devs and learn more in the process. Everybody wins when that happens.</p>

<h3>Thanks SCNA!</h3>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA)</a> gave me the opportunity to present this story as a lightning talk at the conference. Slides are here:</p>

<p>Thank you SCNA! As I shared with the other devs at SCNA, I will gladly post my mistakes and <em>gotchas</em> here for people who want to build a unit like this. Let&rsquo;s build!</p>
