There is something I neglected to cover in a previous blog post, <a href="/blog/2013/11/01/building-an-os-x-app-with-rubymotion/">Building an OS X App With RubyMotion</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve written the OS X app, where do you find the executable, and how do you add it to the <code>Applications</code> folder on the Mac?</p>

<p>Long-time Mac enthusiasts may already know how to do this. The information is included here for completeness.</p>

<h3>Find, Drag, and Drop</h3>

<p>First thing to note: A Mac app named [random-app].app is actually a directory, even though it appears to be a file when viewed in the <code>Applications</code> folder. If you&rsquo;re curious, right-click on any app in the <code>Applications</code> folder and choose <code>Show Package Contents</code> from the speed menu.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After compilation, RubyMotion puts all of the executables in the app&rsquo;s <code>build/</code> directory. Using Finder, drag the folder named <code>[your-app-name].app</code> into the <code>Applications</code> folder.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the command line…</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd [root-directory-of-your-app]
$ cp build/MacOSX-10.8-Development/[your-app-name].app /Applications
$
</code></p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether we copy the file or move it.  RubyMotion creates a new one with every build, when we type <code>rake</code>.</p>

<h3>Launch at Login</h3>

<p>I want the EjectDisks utility to be always available, so it would be good to have it launch automatically at login. That behavior is managed in the <code>Users and Groups</code> preference pane, shown below:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/launch-at-login.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span></p>

<p>Click the <code>+</code> sign, navigate to the app you want to launch at login time (in this case, EjectDisks) and select it. Done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/time-machine-backup-disks.png' width='' height='' alt='Redundancy rocks.' title='Redundancy rocks.'><span class='caption-text'>Redundancy rocks.</span></span>
<a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>&rsquo;s OS X support enabled me to solve a small problem yesterday.  Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>

<h3>Background on Backup</h3>

<p>No matter how much money we spend on computers, the data we create is worth more. The best data protection employs several levels of redundancy.</p>

<p>My backup system starts with Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#timemachinebasics">Time Machine</a>, which handles first level backups painlessly in the background. Time machine is even more effective when multiple disks are used. I like to combine that with online solutions. Redundancy is a good thing.</p>

<p>USB-attached drives work great with Time Machine. I found that Time Machine was inconsistent over WiFi, and when it failed, troubleshooting took too much time. That was a few years ago and things have probably improved since then. I&rsquo;ve never had to troubleshoot a USB-attached Time Machine drive. USB just works. Except when it doesn&rsquo;t. And that&rsquo;s where RubyMotion proved helpful.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Disconnecting USB in a Hurry</h3>

<p>My only problem with USB-attached drives comes when I need to leave my desk in a hurry. You may have seen this message before:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/disk-not-ejected-properly.png' width='' height='' alt='In a hurry to eject?' title='In a hurry to eject?'><span class='caption-text'>In a hurry to eject?</span></span></p>

<p>All three of my USB drives are attached through a single USB hub. Yanking the cable while running for a meeting is… bad! Forgetting to eject even one of the USB drives is also bad.</p>

<p>I solved the problem about a year ago by writing a command line tool that ejects all three drives with one double-click of an icon. Yesterday I deciced to improve my command line tool with RubyMotion.</p>

<h3>Ejecting in a Hurry</h3>

<p><code>EjectDisks</code> is a simple OS X program written with the RubyMotion toolchain for Mac OS X. It uses the <code>osx-status-bar-app-template</code> gem created by <a href="https://github.com/kickcode/osx-status-bar-app-template">Elliott Draper</a>. Here&rsquo;s a 10-second demo.</p>

<center><iframe name="eject-disks-osx" src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/78349497" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The latest version of the EjectDisk code is on <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/EjectDisks">GitHub</a>. The <code>app_delegate.rb</code> file appears below.</p>

<p>```ruby
class AppDelegate
  attr_accessor :status_menu</p>

<p>  def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)</p>

<pre><code>@app_name = NSBundle.mainBundle.infoDictionary['CFBundleDisplayName']

@status_menu = NSMenu.new

@status_item = NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar.statusItemWithLength(NSVariableStatusItemLength).init
@status_item.setMenu(@status_menu)
@status_item.setHighlightMode(true)
@status_item.setTitle(@app_name)

@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("About #{@app_name}", 'orderFrontStandardAboutPanel:')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Custom Action", 'pressAction')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Eject Three Disks", 'ejectThreeDisks')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Say Something", 'sayDroid')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Sing", 'singSomething')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Greetings", 'greetings')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Quit", 'terminate:')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def createMenuItem(name, action)</p>

<pre><code>NSMenuItem.alloc.initWithTitle(name, action: action, keyEquivalent: '')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def pressAction</p>

<pre><code>alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
alert.setMessageText "Action triggered from status bar menu"
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def sayDroid</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello droid)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def singSomething</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def greetings</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello Greetings to the members of Chippewa Valley Code Camp &amp;)
alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
alert.setMessageText "Greetings to the members of Chippewa Valley Code Camp!"
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def ejectThreeDisks</p>

<pre><code>alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
response = %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject SiiGBlack) + "\n"
response += %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject Ultra3TB) + "\n"
response += %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject WDSilver) + "\n"
alert.setMessageText response
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Not everything in the EjectDisks tool is business-related. Do we really need to include a greeting to the members of the <a href="http://chippewavalleycodecamp.com/">Chippewa Valley Code Camp</a>?  Yes, we do!</p>

<p>On the serious side, the app should handle disk ejection as a background process. It&rsquo;s not good to tie up the system for a simple task. Look for a forked process in a future version of the app.</p>

Alexis Finch (<a href="https://twitter.com/agentFin">@agentfin</a>) captured Sketchnotes for a <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> presentation that I gave for <a href="http://meetup.com/geekfest">Groupon&rsquo;s Geekfest</a>.</p>

<p>Sketchnotes are typography and drawing and notes all mixed together.</p>

<p>Alexis is remarkable. It&rsquo;s challenging enough to capture text notes during a presentation. But Alexis managed to turn the talk into meaningful graphics in real time. Something amazing is happening between the ears of Alexis!</p>

<p>Mike Rohde (<a href="http://twitter.com/rohdesign">@rohdesign</a>) developed Sketchnotes when he became frustrated with note-taking. Mike is the go-to guy for anything related to Sketchnotes. He has published videos and a book <a href="http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/">describing the process</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/28/objective-c-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-28T15:52:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/28/objective-c-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/objective-c-big-nerd.png" align="right" width="250" height="357" alt="Objective-C Programming - The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" title="Objective-C Programming - The Big Nerd Ranch Guide"></p>

<blockquote><p>You will be baffled from time to time… Stick with this book. I promise the bewilderment will cease before you get to the final page.<br/>~ Aaron Hillegass, Author</p></blockquote>

<h4>Finding the Right Objective-C Book</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through several Objective-C books in my quest to master <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. You read that right: I&rsquo;m learning Objective-C so that I can master RubyMotion. <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em> is one book that clicks for me. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p>Minimal fluff. Other Objective-C books start off with speeches about why a dev should write for iOS. What a waste of paper. The Big Nerd approach: Start with a few paragraphs about C, and then jump right in to Xcode installation followed by &ldquo;Hello World.&rdquo; Refreshingly direct.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear examples. As I immerse myself deeper into the world of Objective-C, I am troubled by much of the documentation. It&rsquo;s okay to describe a method signature, but a description with an example is much better. While reading other Objective-C books, I found myself pausing to search Stack Overflow for alternate explanations. The Big Nerd book is better because everything is self-contained. Method descriptions are followed by clear examples.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero Assumptions. Even though the book contains minimal fluff, readers will appreciate how the author defines terms throughout the text. For example, the book does not assume that the reader knows the classroom definition of the word <em>syntax</em>. It defines the word explicitly:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Syntax is the set of rules that governs how your code must be written in a given programming language. These rules are extremely specific, and if you fail to follow them, your program won&rsquo;t work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearly put!</p>

<h4>Do I Really Need Objective-C?</h4>

<p>Yes. If you want to be effective with RubyMotion, you must grow strong with Objective-C.</p>

<p>The RubyMotion devs whom I admire most also know Objective-C. Devs like Matt Aimonetti (creator of BubbleWrap), Randall Thomas and Tammer Saleh (authors of <em>RubyMotion in the Cloud</em>), Jonathan Penn (instructor/speaker at CocoaConf) and Laurent Sansonetti (creator of RubyMotion) move seamlessly between the worlds of Ruby and Objective-C. Luke became a Jedi because he followed in the footsteps of Yoda.</p>

<p>More important than following the masters: Learning from their triumphs and mistakes by reading their code. Developers in 2013 are fortunate to have tools like GitHub where code is shared on a massive scale. Most iOS code is written in Objective-C. If we want to learn from the iOS code that has been written before, we need to know Objective-C.</p>

<h4>Highly Recommended</h4>

<p>If you want to develop apps for iOS devices, start with <em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>. The book is also helpful if you prefer RubyMotion over Objective-C.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/26/atari-pong-rubymotion-objective-c/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-26T10:35:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/02/26/atari-pong-rubymotion-objective-c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/pong-rubymotion-objective-c.png" width="300" height="160" alt="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" title="Atari's Pong in RubyMotion and Objective-C" align="right">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Atari&rsquo;s Pong</a> is a classic video arcade game from the 1970s. Seeing Pong always gives me childhood flashbacks.</p>

<h4>Pong in Objective-C</h4>

<p>I recently completed the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated">iOS Accelerated</a> course at the <a href="http://mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers Academy</a>. For one of our homework assignments, we were asked to build a version of Pong that runs on iOS. Our instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/dbora">Don Bora</a>, started us off with some skeleton code in Objective-C. Each student had to take Don&rsquo;s code and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add paddles.</li>
<li>Make the paddles move on their own.</li>
<li>Make the ball bounce off the moving paddles.</li>
<li>Keep score.</li>
<li>Let one or two players control the paddles via touch.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h4>Questions to Consider</h4>

<p>How do you determine whether the pixels of the ball have collided with the pixels of a paddle? What about wall collisions? When a collision occurs, where should the ball bounce next? As with any application, there are many details to consider.</p>

<h4>Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Of course, Don had already introduced the necessary skills in earlier lectures, labs, and homework. It was our job to put the pieces together.</p>

<p>Members of the class paired with each other. We shared solutions and advice. In time, we each ended up with a working version of Pong in Objective-C. It&rsquo;s exciting to see a favorite childhood game running in the iOS simulator on your own machine, especially if you built the game yourself.</p>

<h4>Pong in RubyMotion</h4>

<p>Since my day job revolves around Ruby, it made sense to re-write the exercise in <a href="http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>. Here are video clips of my two solutions. The first was written in Objective-C during the Mobile Makers course. The second was written in RubyMotion.</p>

<center><iframe name="pong-oc" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9LETiMdi9jQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></center>




<center><iframe name="pong-rm" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt-JKqiA_fg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<p>As expected, the two solutions look similar. Source code is on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-oc">Pong in Objective-C</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">Pong in RubyMotion</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>RubyMotion Gotchas</h4>

<p>I encountered a few RubyMotion snags during development:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Mouseovers Ingored</em>. Normally, when running the simulator with RubyMotion, you can mouse over an object in the simulator, hit the command key, and grab a handle to the object.  This behavior was absent in landcape mode with version 1.31 of RubyMotion. The release notes for version 1.33 mention that the problem has been solved. However, that was not my experience.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Touch Events Ignored on Part of Screen</em>. For some reason, the simulator ignored touch events on the right side of the screen. When I programatically moved the right paddle closer to the left side of the screen, both paddles responded to touch events. Searches of Google and Stack Overflow reveal that others have encounterd the same issue with touch events, especially in landcape mode.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Update (3/13/2013): The issue with touch events has been resolved, thanks to advice from Turki Al-Qusaimi in the comments below. Updated code has been pushed to the <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/pong-rm">master branch on GitHub</a>.</em></p>

<p>Of course, I introduced a few bugs of my own while developing the Pong game. At one point, the velocity of the ball increased every time a player scored. It made the game exciting! But I didn&rsquo;t know the cause of the acceleration, and good developers strive to maintain better control over their projects.</p>

<p>I eventually found the acceleration problem: When using an NSTimer object to control animation, you have to invalidate the timer at the beginning of each cycle, or the animation will accelerate. That&rsquo;s a useful thing to know.</p>

<p>The rest of my work in RubyMotion went well, and I continue to enjoy the product. I plan to update the code once the touch event issues have been resolved.</p>

<h4>Why Play Games?</h4>

<p>Why should a serious developer spend time writing games? I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing a game challenges our skills on many levels. In the case of Pong, we have to dust off our old physics and geometry textbooks to ensure that the ball bounces like a real ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a game lets us break out of our constraints. Devs who write business apps are very familiar with constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Because writing a game is fun.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, the most important reason was given by a captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701:</p>

<blockquote><p>The more advanced the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.
<br/>~James T. Kirk</p></blockquote>

<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>

<p>Building the Pong game was an interesting exercise in testing the capabilities of RubyMotion. Having done the work, I can look back and see some areas where I could improve the results. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Automated testing. These proof-of-concept exercises were done without automated testing. What is the best way to apply test driven development to a game? RubyMotion comes with a TDD framework, MacBacon. That would be a great subject for a future blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>Better design. Each exercise looks like something from the 1970s! How would Pong function if it was created in 2013?</p></li>
<li><p>Better collision detection. I&rsquo;m using a built-in iOS method to detect ball collisions. The built-in detection works fine with the stationary walls, but not as well with the moving paddles. If I write a future version of Pong, I should also write a custom collision detection method.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Comments and Pull Requests</h4>

<p><a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">My team and I</a> build business apps. My gaming experience is limited. If you are a game developer, and if you see anything in my code that could be done better, your ideas are welcome. Feel free to submit a <a href="http://github.com/rayhightower/pong-rm">pull request via GitHub</a>, or you can drop a note in the comments below. Thanks!</p>
