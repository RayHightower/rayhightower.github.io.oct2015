    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/08/28/when-at-is-a-tweets-first-character/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-28T15:59:01-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/08/28/when-at-is-a-tweets-first-character</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/at_sign.png">
Something we should know about putting an &ldquo;@&rdquo; in the first character position on Twitter&hellip;</p>

<h3>Limited Visibility</h3>

<p>When you start a tweet with a Twitter handle (with the &ldquo;@&rdquo; in the first character position) Twitter interprets that as a message to another Twitter user. Only people who follow <em>both</em> the sender and receiver will see the message in their stream.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For example, if this tweet is sent from the @ChicagoRuby handle, only people who follow both @ChicagoRuby and @WindyCityRails will see it in their streams:</p>

<blockquote><p>@WindyCityRails speakers announced! SOLID, engines, Kubernetes, Capybara, performance. Check them out! <a href="http://ow.ly/NsP0k">http://ow.ly/NsP0k</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Attendees who only follow @ChicagoRuby or @WindyCityRails (not both) will never see this tweet in their Twitter stream.</p>

<h3>Sometimes You Want It That Way</h3>

<p>Think of an &ldquo;@&rdquo; reply as a way to chat with another person, and you don&rsquo;t mind if other people overhear the conversation. In fact, sometimes an eavesdropper can add value to the conversation. Twitter is kind of like real life in that way.</p>

<h3>Normal Visibility</h3>

<p>For normal visibility, start the tweet with any character other than &ldquo;@&rdquo;. Some people will start with a &ldquo;.&rdquo; in the first position. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>.@WindyCityRails speakers announced! SOLID, engines, Kubernetes, Capybara, performance. Check them out! <a href="http://ow.ly/NsP0k">http://ow.ly/NsP0k</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Or you can re-phrase the tweet entirely. Just be sure to keep the &ldquo;@&rdquo; out of the first character position. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Speakers announced for @WindyCityRails! SOLID, engines, Kubernetes, Capybara, performance. Check them out! <a href="http://ow.ly/NsP0k">http://ow.ly/NsP0k</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Try It Out</h3>

<p>If you have multiple Twitter accounts that you can experiment with, try out a few combinations and you&rsquo;ll see this behavior in action.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/07/20/the-lambdajam-2015-experience/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-20T09:41:04-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/07/20/the-lambdajam-2015-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/LambdaJam.png' width='' height='' alt='Lambda Jam 2015' title='Lambda Jam 2015'><span class='caption-text'>Lambda Jam 2015</span></span>
Working in software development is like being the proverbial kid in candy store. Every new language is a shiny and delicious thing. <a href="http://lambdajam.com">Lambda Jam</a> (which bounces between Chicago and Melbourne) is a traveling candy store. And, like the kid in the candy store, I am sometimes distracted by tangential temptation.</p>

<p>Most of my time is spent running <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a>, where we focus on Ruby and Swift. We&rsquo;re object-oriented all the way. Given that, why would I want to attend a functional programming conference like Lambda Jam? For the brain-stretching experience. If your background is anything like mine, you might enjoy it, too. Hereâ€™s why.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Motivation: Parallelism and Concurrency</h3>

<p>One immediate reason to explore FP: The impending end of Moore&rsquo;s Law.  For over half a century we&rsquo;ve taken it for granted that we could double the number of transistors on a wafer every 18 months or so. But the laws of physics are catching up to us, and now we need to create new ways to boost computer performance. Two potential performance boosters: Parallelism and concurrency.</p>

<p>And yes, as Rob Pike points out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso&amp;list=PLOnWKC1gI_OPU8SDIBnCLHsgzNLSbnPJQ&amp;index=8">Concurrency is Not Parallelism</a>. Concurrency enables parallelism.</p>

<p>Certain features of FP reduce the pain of writing concurrent programs.  For example, data immutability will not allow two (or more) instances of the same process to over-write the same data. Developers trained to write serially-executing programs never have this concern. But if we want the benefits of concurrency, we need to acknowledge and attack a new set of challenges.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href="/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">Parallella</a> offers one way to explore parallelism and concurrency in hardware. What a board!</p>

<h3>FP, Physics, and Calculus</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/conal">Conal Elliott</a> kicked off Lambda Jam by making connections between FP, physics, and calculus. He shared why concurrent models are difficult to reason about. And then he shared methods of abstraction that we can use to overcome the difficulty.</p>

<p>One abstraction tool, mentioned by Elliott and shared by some of the other presenters: Types. Ruby is a dynamically typed language, employing &ldquo;duck typing&rdquo; as needed. The flexibility that comes from duck typing sometimes leads to unintended consequences. A strongly typed language, like Haskell or Clojure, can make certain programming errors obvious before we put our code into production.</p>

<h3>Haskell Tutorial</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ranjitjhala">Ranjit Jhala</a>&rsquo;s Haskell tutorial offered a chance to put some FP ideas into practice. The idea of attending a Haskell tutorial was intimidating. But I went anyway, and I&rsquo;m glad that I did. Jhala made the material accessible. I left the Haskell tutorial with some hands-on experience and a new appreciation for FP (in general) and Haskell in particular.</p>

<h3>Hallway Conversations</h3>

<p>Serendipity is a huge benefit of any conference. I ran into a <a href="http://devmyndsoftware.com">DevMynd</a> developer, <a href="http://twitter.com/pushcx">Peter Harkins</a>, who uses FP principles to make his Ruby code more robust. To learn more about this approach, check out <a href="https://www.windycityrails.org/videos/2013/#2">Jessica Kerr</a>&rsquo;s FP presentation at WindyCityRails 2013.</p>

<h3>The Venue: South Shore</h3>

<p>Any recap of Lambda Jam 2015 would be incomplete without a description of the venue, <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/South-Shore-Cultural-Center/">South Shore Cultural Center (SSCC)</a>. Some of you will remember SSCC as the venue for WindyCityRails 2012 and 2013. It&rsquo;s in the middle of a golf course, next to Lake Michigan. The retreat-type atmosphere is great for brain work. Hats off to the Lambda Jam organizers for the choice. I look forward to a return visit.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Much of the FP material at Lambda Jam was over my head. And yet a great deal was accessible to me. As developers, we must always stretch ourselves to learn more; that&rsquo;s how we grow. Lambda Jam is great for stretching, and great for growth.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Getting Started With Jekyll]]></title>
    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/06/24/getting-started-with-jekyll/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-24T16:02:38-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/06/24/getting-started-with-jekyll</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/jekyll-responsive.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Jekyll, the static HTML generator.' title='Jekyll, the static HTML generator.'><span class='caption-text'>Jekyll, the static HTML generator.</span></span></p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static HTML generator for web sites that don&rsquo;t require a content management system (CMS). Jekyll sites load quickly, especially when combined with GitHub Pages. <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyreys">Bobby Reyes</a> and I will present Jekyll at ChicagoRuby: 1871 on Thursday, June 25, 2015. Slides are below.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>You may already know that RayHightower.com is powered by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> (as of the date of this article). Octopress sits on top of Jekyll. Recently, I discovered that Jekyll offers some advantages that will help this blog greatly, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A larger community than Octopress. As Linus Torvalds says: With many eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of templates. I am not a designer. Further, since this is a simple blog, an amazing design would be overkill. But the blog must look crisp and professional, right? Jekyll templates that meet my needs are widely available.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Migration Happening Now</h3>

<p>This blog&rsquo;s migration from Octopress to Jekyll is underway. Iâ€™ll post when itâ€™s done. In the meantime, take a look at the slides from the Jekyll presentation at ChicagoRuby.</p>

This 82-second video shows how to launch a Jekyll site with the default template.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br/></p>

<h3>Thanks, Octopress!</h3>

<p>I am grateful to the Octopress community for introducing me to static page generators. Jekyll is the next logical step for me. And, since technology is always changing, it will be exciting to learn what&rsquo;s next.</p>
