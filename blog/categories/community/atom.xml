<a href="http://sgi.com">Silicon Graphics International Corporation (SGI)</a> computers rendered the special effects for the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a> movie. Computer enthusiasts coveted SGI machines throughout the 1990s.</p>

<p>But success in the computer industry is fleeting. A few years after Jurassic Park, a convergence of tech advances (Moore&rsquo;s Law, x86 architecture, and Linux) made it possible for commodity PCs to perform as well as SGI&rsquo;s premium workstations. Wall Street traders and other power users abandoned workstations in favor of Linux-based PCs. High-end makers like SGI fell on hard times.</p>

<p>Today, SGI is fighting back. The company is blending x86, Linux, and (buzzword alert) big data to attack the high performance computing market. The vision was presented at this month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/163287562/">Chicago ACM</a> meeting by Brian Freed, VP of Strategy for SGI.</p>

<h3>What is Big Data?</h3>

<p>Freed shared a definition of big data from <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/01/what-is-big-data.html">Edd Dumbill&rsquo;s O'Reilly Radar article</a>. Big data is characterized by volume (lots of it), variety (it&rsquo;s unstructured), and velocity (the data changes quickly).</p>

<p>In the words of the O'Reilly author&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Big data is data that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems. The data is too big, moves too fast, or doesn’t fit the strictures of your database architectures. To gain value from this data, you must choose an alternative way to process it.</p>

<p>~Edd Dumbill</p></blockquote>

<p>Definitions are fine, but it&rsquo;s more important to understand <em>why</em> a company might care about big data. Here are a few examples that Freed shared during the ACM meeting.</p>

<h3>Example: Fraud Detection with Big Data</h3>

<p>Consider one challenge faced by credit card companies. When a credit card is presented for an online purchase, how does the authorizing body know if the charge is legitimate? Can legitimacy be determined in a timely fashion, before an impatient buyer abandons a slow seller for a quicker seller?</p>

<p>Sellers who decide too quickly will suffer fraud. Sellers who decide too slowly will lose customers. The problem is amplified because millions of shoppers are clicking the &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; button simultaneously, and they all expect an answer <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>Traditional fraud detection systems could measure just a few potential fraud criteria within the allowed time window. SGI solves the problem with <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop clusters</a> running on SGI hardware. This big data design is able to examine each transaction deeper, and render a yes/no decision faster. Buyers are happier because they can complete a purchase faster. Companies are happier because fraud is reduced.</p>

<p>Big data helps credit card companies to make better authorization decisions in less time.</p>

<h3>Example: Auto Manufacturing</h3>

<p>Some problems, like credit authorization, require a quick response.  Other problems, like manufacturing, require the problem solver to crunch large volumes of data.</p>

<p>Consider an auto manufacturer. Every system in the modern automobile is controlled by software on silicon. Where software runs, data can be collected. The data piles up rapidly over time.</p>

<p>Manufacturers have discovered some unexpected benefits of collecting so much data. For example, they can identify trends like common failures among components, and use that data to improve future components. They can spot hidden trends, like geographic issues related to extreme cold or heat, and then design parts that are specially equipped for the target environment.</p>

<p>For these particular manufacturing examples, handling huge volumes of data is more important than delivering a quick answer. Insights that lead to quality improvements can be delivered in hours, and that&rsquo;s fast enough for the designers. Before big data, many design decisions were driven by instinct and experience alone. Big data helps auto companies to make more informed decisions.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls of Big Data</h3>

<p>One big pitfall is trying to use the big data <em>hammer</em> for every <em>nail</em> in sight, whether the solution fits the problem or not. It&rsquo;s the same hazard we face with any new technology. We run the risk of using a sledgehammer when a fly swatter would do.</p>

<p>A few ways to avoid the pitfalls: Start small. Have goals. And, like any good agile software developer, iterate. In Freed&rsquo;s words&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Successful implementation of big data is not an event. It is an iterative process where we continuously learn over time.</p></blockquote>

<h3>About Chicago ACM</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/">The Chicago Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (Chicago ACM)</a> is on fire. December&rsquo;s meeting featured a supercomputing presentation by <a href="/blog/2013/12/12/high-performance-computing-at-acm/">Sharan Kalwani of Fermilab</a>. The February meeting was all about SGI&rsquo;s push into big data, and next month will focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). The organizers are assembling an exciting combination of events. Looking forward to more!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who offered feedback on <a href="/blog/2014/01/21/an-environment-of-respect/">An Environment of Respect</a>, which included an early draft of the WindyCityRails Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>The frank and earnest exchange of ideas was educational. Some of the feedback was positive, on the order of &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all colleagues, we treat each other with respect, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, I paid special attention to the negative feedback because it surprised me. Surprise happens when I face something that I do not understand. When I encounter something that I do not understand, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for learning.</p>

<p>So I did what I always do when I need to learn more. I spoke with people who know more than me.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Wise Counsel</h3>

<p>Several people in our industry were generous when I asked for advice. One technology veteran summed it up this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>You wrote a code of conduct for an Environment of Respect. 99.9% of the people will know what that means, and they can even function well without a code. But a code of conduct needs to written for an Environment of Hostility&hellip; for the one fool who doesn&rsquo;t know how to act.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a discussion about reducing bureaucracy, one developer offered this view:</p>

<blockquote><p>Think of it less as bureaucracy and more along the lines of “In case of emergency, break glass and help is on the way.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I am grateful to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts.</p>

<h3>Verbose and Draconian? Not Here.</h3>

<p>Some of the advice seemed to point toward a more verbose and draconian code of conduct, like the ones suggested by a few people last week. Not good. If we have a code, it&rsquo;s better to avoid the threatening tone. WindyCityRails is a community of colleagues who treat each other with respect.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one member of our team found a code that works. Every member of the community is treated like an independent-thinking adult who respects the rights of others. Expectations are clear, and the threatening tone is gone.</p>

<h3>Ruby DCamp: Thanks</h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/elight">Evan Light</a> wrote the original version of this code of conduct for <a href="http://rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a>. When asked for permission to use his work for WindyCityRails, Evan responded with an enthusiastic <em>yes</em>. Thanks Evan!</p>

<p>Here it is.</p>

<h3>Draft: Code of Conduct</h3>

<h4>Preface</h4>

<p>WindyCityRails is and has been an event made up of welcoming, tolerant, compassionate, and loving participants. For several years now, WindyCityRails participants have been respectful of one another in our differences. We have employed those differences to elevate, educate, and celebrate one another at WindyCityRails.</p>

<p>It is in that same spirit that we now adopt this Code of Conduct: Not as a punitive action, but as a measure to protect that which we already have and to signal to all that we are a tolerant and loving community.</p>

<h4>WindyCityRails Code of Conduct</h4>

<p>WindyCityRails is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. WindyCityRails participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the event organizers' discretion. This applies to all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and otherwise.</p>

<p>That said, silliness, mockery, and general irreverence are welcome, expected, and even encouraged so long as they all come from a loving place.</p>

<p>However, should another participant&rsquo;s behavior be injurious to you, we ask three things.</p>

<h4>1) Give others the benefit of the doubt.</h4>

<p>People are generally decent. It has been our experience, these past several years, that those who attend WindyCityRails are just a cut above in that respect.</p>

<h4>2) Attempt to address the behavior with the other party immediately.</h4>

<p>In the case of intractable situations, we are here to help you (see &ldquo;Ask for Help!&rdquo; below). However, this is where we ask participants to try to behave &ldquo;like grown ups.&rdquo; It is part of the WindyCityRails ethos: If you have a problem with something, don&rsquo;t wait for someone to fix it but instead try to fix it yourself.</p>

<p>If you’re comfortable doing so, let the person know that you found what he or she said or did inappropriate. Attempt to resolve the situation amicably. When addressing it yourself, remember to continue to treat the other party with kindness and respect.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable approaching the other person…</p>

<h4>3) Ask for Help!</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re all human. While life, and WindyCityRails, expects a good deal of self-sufficiency, we are also a community. If you cannot manage a situation alone, we are here for you. Seek out any member of the conference organizer team. We can be identified with special &ldquo;Organizer&rdquo; lanyards.</p>

<p>~WindyCityRails Organizers Team</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <updated>2014-01-21T13:16:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/21/an-environment-of-respect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is an early draft of the <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> Code of Conduct:</p>

<blockquote><p>WindyCityRails strives to provide a healthy, harassment-free conference experience for all attendees. Our Code of Conduct, which has been practiced by members of our community for years, is as follows: Treat everyone at the conference as you would want yourself, a family member, or an esteemed colleague to be treated. Our community is stronger when every member contributes to the safety and learning of the other members. We are colleagues, and we treat each other with respect.</p></blockquote>

<p>There may be some wordsmithing and typo-correction this week, but the final version will essentially read as it appears above. Key objectives achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity. The point is made with minimal words.</li>
<li>Inclusiveness. Everybody who wants to learn and engage is included.</li>
<li>Respect. Everybody is treated with respect. No threats are made.</li>
</ul>


<p>You have already read the most important part of this post. The rest tells how the code came to be.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>First Person Singular</h3>

<p>Normally, when discussing WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby, I shine the light on the organizers as a team (we) rather than on myself. WindyCityRails is blessed with a great team of organizers. We pool our talents to get things done.</p>

<p>However, when concerns are raised, the buck stops with the team leader: me. Please forgive me for using first person pronouns throughout this post. Also, other members of the organizer team may have opinions that differ from mine. If I say anything here that disturbs you, please know that it comes from me directly. I am the only one at fault.</p>

<h3>My Knee-Jerk Response</h3>

<p>Last week a Twitter user asked if WindyCityRails had a code of conduct. I responded (through the @WindyCityRails handle) with a one-word answer: No.</p>

<p>Why the terse response? Because I have a deep bias against bureaucracy. Initially, that&rsquo;s what a code of conduct sounded like to me. Do we have a problem with diversity in the tech community? Hell yes. But bureaucracy does not solve problems. We will only solve the diversity problem through active engagement and real work. We solve the diversity problem by ensuring that people from all groups feel welcome and engaged.</p>

<p>One example of real work: The <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/youth/">WindyCityRails Youth Program</a>, launched last year. A diverse group of college students taught a diverse group of high school students how to program the Arduino. These students from diverse backgrounds bonded via their common interest in technology.</p>

<p>To summarize my knee-jerk response: A code of conduct makes us feel good about nice words written on a sheet of paper, while no real work gets done.</p>

<h3>After My Initial Reaction</h3>

<p>Kindergarten taught me that it is important for me to listen to others. A community thrives on interaction between people who see things differently. If everyone thinks the same way, we don&rsquo;t have diversity, do we?</p>

<p>Other inquiries about a code of conduct followed via Twitter and email. All were helpful. Some people offered sample text from other events. Most of the sample text was good.</p>

<p>Two of my fellow organizers (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a>) encouraged me to examine the question more closely. Clearly, I needed to study this. So that is how I have spent the last few days.</p>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>In drafting text for WindyCityRails (and, by extension, ChicagoRuby) I tried to create something that fits our culture. We are an inclusive group and we treat people well.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is important to keep the word count low to limit bureaucracy.</p>

<h3>Inclusiveness</h3>

<p>The WindyCityRails and ChicagoRuby communities have always strived to be inclusive. We do that in several ways.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Before I became an organizer of ChicagoRuby, I heard that a group of developers met for drinks after every meeting. I always heard about the gathering after the fact. I could have taken this personally, but I realized that the group was not intentionally excluding me. They just didn&rsquo;t know me. Further, they were so caught up in their discussions that it simply never occurred to them to invite people they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Things are different today. Today we announce the drink invitation at the beginning of each meeting, and we post it with every meeting announcement. Brand new people are made to feel welcome.</p>

<p>Further, we make it clear that one does not have to drink alcohol to participate. Soft drinks and cranberry juice are in abundance.</p>

<p>Another example of inclusiveness: All of ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s monthly events are free because we want to include aspiring developers regardless of income. Expenses for the monthly events are covered by monthly sponsors and revenue from WindyCityRails.</p>

<h3>Excluding Others</h3>

<p>I have more experience with racism than any other -ism, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll talk about here. A mentor of mine raised two questions during a discussion about racism and oppression.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you want to end all oppression, or just the oppression directed at you?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you really want to end oppression, or do you simply want to change places with your oppressor?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an experience that influences my thoughts on this subject. A few decades ago, when I was a young developer for a company in Colorado, I had a confrontation with senior developer, a White man. I was certain that this was a Black/White issue. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but I will admit that I treated that White man very badly in retaliation.</p>

<p>Some days later, as I walked past my manager&rsquo;s desk, I noticed my &ldquo;nemesis&rdquo; interacting with my manager (a White man who also happened to be his manager) in the same manner that he had interacted with me. That&rsquo;s when I figured out that this guy wasn&rsquo;t a racist, he was just an asshole.</p>

<p>And, because of the way I had treated him, I was the one guilty of racism.</p>

<p>In drafting the WindyCityRails code of conduct, it was important to avoid showing favoritism toward any group. All groups must be treated with respect, not just my own.</p>

<h3>Respect</h3>

<p>I was disturbed by the language in some of the sample codes of conduct. It took me awhile to figure out what bothered me. Finally, it hit me: The tone was threatening. They seemed to say (paraphrased): &ldquo;Follow these rules or we will kick you out and take away your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colleagues don&rsquo;t threaten each other. Colleagues treat each other with respect.</p>

<p>Some may point out that without a method of enforcement, the code has no teeth. They&rsquo;re right. There are no teeth. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; or threats are needed amongst colleagues. Colleagues treat each other with respect.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There you have it&hellip; my opinion. Can my opinion change? Perhaps. I have many blind spots, and that is why I am sharing my thought process. I look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments below or over a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails call for proposals</a> is still open, as of the date of this post. If you are doing something exciting with Ruby and/or Rails, please submit a proposal. Thanks.</p>

<h3><em>Update (Jan 2014)</em></h3>

<p><em>After this post, several colleagues introduced me to new information.  The result, an updated code of conduct, is covered in <a href="/blog/2014/01/28/an-environment-of-respect-2nd-iteration/">An Environment of Respect, 2nd Iteration</a>.</em></p>

    <updated>2013-12-12T22:22:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/12/12/high-performance-computing-at-acm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/cray-1.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Cray-1 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.' title='Cray-1 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.'><span class='caption-text'>Cray-1 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.</span></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Anyone can build a fast CPU. The trick is to build a fast system.
&nbsp;<br/>
~ Seymour Cray</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chicago chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href="http://www.chicagoacm.org/">Chicago ACM</a>) hosted a lecture titled <em>Supercomputing and You</em> yesterday evening. The talk was delivered by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharankalwani">Sharan Kalwani</a> of <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>. Kalwani&rsquo;s background blends mechanical engineering and computer science with decades of high performance computing experience.</p>

<h3>10x => High Performance Computing</h3>

<p>Kalwani began his talk by drawing a distinction between <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing (HPC)</em>. Supercomputing is the buzzword that everyone knows, but the word implies that the designers are focused only on improving CPU performance. Such narrow focus could cause us to ignore important subsystems. For example, if engineers focus strictly on CPU performance, applications that are CPU-bound will quickly encounter I/O bottlenecks. High performance computing takes the entire system into account: CPU, I/O, cache, memory&hellip; anything that can influence performance.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This article will use the terms <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing</em> interchangably because we are discussing the field in general. In an engineering document, the distinction would be more important.</p>

<p>By definition, supercomputers perform at least ten times faster than the current state-of-the art. The definition is a moving target. The processor in today&rsquo;s smartphone would have been considered a high performance computer a decade ago.</p>

<h3>The First Supercomputer</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cray.com/">Seymour Cray</a> is regarded as the father of the supercomputer. Cray cobbled together the first supercomputer using off-the-shelf components of the day and his unique ideas about computer architecture.</p>

<p>For example, Cray observed that the speed of an electrical signal was one bottleneck in computer performance. Electrical signals travel at the speed of light. Light can travel roughly one foot in one nanosecond.  Therefore, Cray decided that all internal cables in his new system would be less than a foot in length. No input would need to wait more than a nanosecond for a signal.</p>

<p>The 1972-era Cray supercomputer ran at a clock speed of 80MHz. It used a 64-bit word size. As a point of comparison, a 1972-era business mainframe ran at 4MHz with a 16-bit word size.</p>

<h3>Supercomputers&hellip; So What?</h3>

<p>Why do we need to spend time and money on high performance computers?  How does the general public benefit?</p>

<p>HPC enables us to solve problems that elude typical computers. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Auto safety testing</em>. Kalwani spent several years using HPC to run simulated crash tests for General Motors. A physical crash test, one in which the car is destroyed, costs $500k per car. The same test can be run in a simulator for $5k. Engineers still need to test a physical car at the end of the testing cycle, but the number of cars destroyed is drastically reduced. The business advantage of HPC-simulated tests is clear.</li>
<li><em>Nuclear testing</em>. It is very expensive (measured both in dollars and in human lives) to test a nuclear power plant. Fortunately, scientists know enough about nuclear behavior to create realistic simulations. Testing via simulation helps to manage costs and reduce accidents.</li>
<li><em>Weather forecasting</em>. The first supercomputers needed three days to predict the weather for <em>tomorrow</em>. What good is a 2-day-old weather forecast? A good forecast can save lives by telling people to evacute before a life-threatening natural disaster. Today&rsquo;s supercomputers can produce accurate weather forecasts while the reader still has time to take action.</li>
<li><em>Bioinformatics</em>. When scientists can reliably simulate drug behavior before live human testing, medical treatments can be improved and lives can be saved.</li>
<li><em>Energy exploration</em>. As long as people depend on fossil fuels, new sources need to be discovered in a timely and cost-effective way.  Supercomputers can process seismic data quickly and with sufficient granularity to tell prospectors where to drill.</li>
</ul>


<p>The bottom line: High performance computers deliver a return on investment that far outweighs their cost.</p>

<h3>Trickle Down Technology</h3>

<p>Many of the advances that we enjoy on today&rsquo;s laptops were invented by HPC architects. Kalwani shared one example: Cray invented the solid state disk (SSD) when mechanical disk drives proved to be a bottleneck. Can you imagine what an SSD must have cost in 1982 when it was invented? Today, SSDs are standard equipment on many laptops.</p>

<h3>Who Has the Fastest Supercomputer?</h3>

<p><a href="http://top500.org/">Top500.org</a> lists the fastest supercomputers on the planet, ordered by number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The race to be the fastest is highly competitive, so check the list for the latest champion.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the Top 500 list is missing a few names. Some governments or companies might not want to publicize their HPC skills.</p>

<h3>Speed vs. Power</h3>

<p>Supercomputers gulp electricity. Rule of thumb: One megawatt of electricity used over the course of one year costs $1 million. The fastest supercomputer in the world uses 17 megawatts of electricity, so its owners have an annual electric bill of $17 million dollars.</p>

<p><a href="http://green500.org">The Green 500</a> list recognizes the most energy efficient supercomputers in the world.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Paradigm</h3>

<p>Kalwani closed the historical section of his talk with a discussion of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">The Fourth Paradigm</a> of discovery. The concept comes from a collection of essays published by Microsoft Press. As of this writing, a free PDF of the book is available from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">Microsoft Research</a>.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s introduction posits that there have been four paradigms of human scientific discovery:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Empirical</em>. Started a thousand years ago. Science was all about describing natural phenomena.</li>
<li><em>Theoretical</em>. Started a few hundred years ago. Scientific understanding is achieved via models and generalizations.</li>
<li><em>Computational</em>. Started a few decades ago. Scientists seek understanding by simulating complex phenomena using computer models.</li>
<li><em>Data Exploration (eScience)</em>. Starting now. Scientists now have the technology to capture and store huge quantities of data, inexpensively and indefinitely. Software will &ldquo;look&rdquo; for trends in the data using statistical models. The software will identify trends in the data, and point them out for further investigation.</li>
</ul>


<p>One example of the Fourth Paradigm in action: Recent discoveries of sub-atomic particles were initiated by eScience. Software running on high performance computers identified trends, and the scientists followed up with deeper investigation. Discoveries followed after that.</p>

<p>Businesses have led the way in extracting trends from mountains of data. This path offered limited results for scientists because computers were too slow to handle scientific data in a timely fashion. Partial differential equations eat many CPU cycles!</p>

<p>High performance computing opens up a new universe of data insight for scientists and engineers.</p>

<h3>The Future of HPC</h3>

<p>Kalwani ended the talk by looking into his crystal ball and telling us about the future of HPC. A few trends on the horizon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Power consumption issues will dominate discussions. High performance computers are terribly inefficient. Either we need to find a free, unlimited supply of energy (unlikely) or we must design supercomputers that gulp less power.</li>
<li>GPGPUs. General purpose graphics processing units are already used for non-graphics applications, like Bitcoin mining. As more applications are discovered for the devices, faster GPGPUs will follow.</li>
<li>ARM. Advanced Risc Machine processors use less power and their performance continues to increase. Could ARM hold the key to power reduction in high performance computing?</li>
<li>Rex Parallella. Fresh from last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing Conference</a>: <a href="http://www.rexcomputing.com/">Rex Computing</a> is using <a href="http://www.parallella.org/">Parallella</a> boards to build low-energy high performance computing clusters.</li>
<li>Quantum computing. Kalwani ran out of time as he was covering this item, but he shared enough to spark my interest. He explained quantum computing by using an analogy: Quantum computing is to digital computing as digital computing is to the abacus. The degree of advancement is that dramatic. <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a> is one company exploring this area.</li>
</ul>
