    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many motors are in the typical automobile? The knee-jerk response might be “one, the big metal thing under the hood”. Upon further reflection, we may recall the motors that operate many devices in today’s automobile: windshield wipers, power windows, door locks, sun roof, reclining seats, and so on. Power devices were once luxury equipment. Today, since motors have fallen in price, most cars include these <em>luxury</em> items as standard equipment.</p>

<p>We take motors for granted, therefore motors have disappeared. And now, as it becomes possible to add a computer and an IP address to almost anything electronic, we bring about the Internet of Things (IoT). Computers are disappearing too.</p>

<h3>ACM Presents Disruptive IoT</h3>

<p>Steven Loving is a director at <a href="http://www.arrayent.com/">Arrayent</a>. Arrayent makes a platform for companies that want their products to be IoT-aware. For example, a garage door company that wants to offer iPhone control to their customers can do so without re-inventing TCP/IP themselves. Arrayent handles the IoT portion so the maker can focus on their core business. Steven shared his vision of the IoT future at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/184091062/">Tuesday&rsquo;s ACM meeting</a>. Some of his ideas are summarized here.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Leave Home Without It</h3>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t leave home without it</em> was once the catch phrase of a major charge card. Today, many of us leave home with just three things in our pockets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wallet</li>
<li>Keys</li>
<li>Smartphone</li>
</ul>


<p>As near-field communication (or one of its descendants) becomes prevalent, we may only need the smartphone.</p>

<h3>Products Don&rsquo;t Matter Any More?</h3>

<p>Products don&rsquo;t matter any more? I immediately wanted to argue against this idea. Everyone wants quality products, right? The point: As manufacturing techniques become common knowledge, companies need to come up with new ways to differentiate themselves from the competition.</p>

<p>Connected products are special. For example, consider an ordinary sump pump. How does a buyer distinguish one from another? If one sump pump contains a tiny embedded Linux system with an IP address, it can alert the owner when water has approached a dangerous level, if there is a power outage, or if flood conditions are simply too strong for the pump to handle. Bad news does not get better with time, and if the sump pump can send bad news early, the owners can take corrective action while there&rsquo;s still time to do so.</p>

<h3>Mobile First</h3>

<p>A great quote from the presentation&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you know anybody building a product with an LCD on it? Shoot them.  I have an LCD in my pocket. It&rsquo;s called a phone.
<br/>~Steven Loving</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the mobile-first strategy that many developers apply to apps also applies to IoT.</p>

<p>Side note: Clearly, Apple gets it. That&rsquo;s one reason why they released <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/">HomeKit</a>.</p>

<h3>Incumbent Companies Are Scrambling</h3>

<p>Why are cable companies offering security services in addition to standard packages of television and movies? Because users are moving to Netflix and Amazon Prime. Cable companies that offer internet service must come up with other services if they expect to survive. IoT might offer a way. Self-installed home monitoring services will give customers a reason to stick with their old cable provider. Of course, this will force security companies like ADT to come up with something new, too.</p>

<h3>IoT Progression</h3>

<p>What opportunities will become available when every device has an IP
address? Tuesday&rsquo;s presenter predicts the following sequence of
events:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connected products.</li>
<li>Connected systems &ndash; products talking to other products.</li>
<li>Communities of systems talking to each other.</li>
<li>Network effects.</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;re currently experiencing &#35;1 and &#35;2. What will happen as &#35;3 and &#35;4 begin to roll out? We cannot be sure. However, we can be certain that this will be an exciting time for software developers, electrical engineers, and entrepreneurs who build companies in those areas.</p>

<h3>Thanks Chicago ACM</h3>

<p>Thanks again Chicago ACM for putting on a great program.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-16T17:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the early days of robots people said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s build a robot&rsquo; and what&rsquo;s the first thought? You make a robot look like a human and do human things. That&rsquo;s so 1950s. We are so past that.
<br/>~Neil deGrasse Tyson</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov-uw.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.' title='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.</span></span>
<a href="http://openrov.com">OpenROV</a> is an underwater robot, roughly the size of a toaster, and definitely not human-shaped. The device is controlled through a Node.js-based web app. Former NASA researcher Eric Stackpole and Make Magazine columnist David Lang are on a mission to democratize ocean exploration in the same way that Jobs and Woz sparked the democratization of  computing. Eric and David pooled their talents to launch OpenROV, building on the foundation laid by Moore’s Law and the open source software movement.</p>

<p>OpenROV&rsquo;s ingredients are an impressive mix of open source goodness&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>BeagleBone Black &ndash; an open-source single-board computer, smaller than a deck of cards, running Linux.</li>
<li>Linux &ndash; specifically, the Ubuntu distribution.</li>
<li>Node.js &ndash; platform for building web applications, based on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. Thanks to Node.js, any laptop running a web browser can control the OpenROV.</li>
<li>Arduino &ndash; inexpensive micro-controller commonly used in robotics projects.</li>
<li>TCP/IP &ndash; the communication protocol of the Internet. TCP/IP handles all communications (commands, video) between the OpenROV and the pilot’s laptop.</li>
</ul>


<p>The OpenROV team has released all of their <a href="https://github.com/openrov">schematics and source code</a> to the open source community, hence the word “open” in the company name. If you think the open source aspects of OpenROV are exciting, wait until you hear about the company&rsquo;s main mission: Underwater exploration.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Eric and David were kind enough to invite me to their lab/manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California recently. Thank you, OpenROV makers!</p>

<h3>Remotely Operated Vehicles</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Laptop, browser, and game controller.' title='Laptop, browser, and game controller.'><span class='caption-text'>Laptop, browser, and game controller.</span></span>
ROV is short for remotely operated vehicle, an underwater robot. Scientists use ROVs to study marine life. Oil companies use ROVs for underwater construction and inspections. Industry-grade ROVs are priced at $30,000 on the low-end, while a <a href="http://www.mbari.org/twenty/Tiburon.htm">custom ROV can cost several million dollars</a>.</p>

<p>The OpenROV team was convinced that they could design and build an ROV small enough to fit in a suitcase, and easy enough for a citizen scientist to assemble and maintain. Targeting the general public meant achieving a relatively low price point: under one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>

<p>They did it. The device is successful, and you can <a href="http://store.openrov.com/">buy an OpenROV</a> kit today for $849.00.</p>

<p>Movements are controlled via a USB-connected video game controller. A Bluetooth-equipped controller should work just as well. Some users will prefer the laptop keyboard; that works too.</p>

<p>In other words, the computer that you’re using to read this article can probably control the OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Citizen Science</h3>

<p>Our world will always need professional scientists, people working in academia and in industry to push the frontier of knowledge. Some scientific problems require the attention of PhD-level professionals, while other problems are better solved through crowdsourcing. Enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen scientist</a>.</p>

<p>Professional scientists are good at analyzing data, because that&rsquo;s what they have trained themselves to do. But data gathering requires less training than analysis. Citizen science and crowdsourcing work when there&rsquo;s an overwhelming volume of data to gather. Or when the breakthrough is beyond the reach of current scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists may be constrained by money, but they tend to be unconstrained by expertise. Therefore they are likely to try solutions that experts would never consider. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">Orville and Wilbur Wright</a> were citizen scientists. Professional scientists pursued solutions for fixed-wing flight prior to the Wright brothers' success. But since the flight problem defied the known science of the day, new approaches were required.</p>

<p>Amusingly, successful citizen scientists can be outwitted by their own expertise, just like the professionals. For example&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris &hellip;[because] no known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping.
<br/>~Orville Wright</p></blockquote>

<p>Shifting back to the 21st century: Thousands of citizen scientists are using OpenROV to explore oceans and lakes more thoroughly than ever before.</p>

<h3>Open Source On-Site</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/ui-discussion-2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.' title='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.'><span class='caption-text'>Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.</span></span>
On the day I visited the OpenROV factory, other underwater enthusiasts were on-site, working with company engineers on product improvements. One enthusiast is a professional pilot of manned submersibles, underwater vehicles large enough to hold people. This pilot has traveled as deep as 2,000 meters below the ocean&rsquo;s surface! &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking at amperage&rdquo;, she said in a discussion with another enthusiast. A spike in amperage could indicate a ground fault, and batteries drain rapidly when that happens. You do not want to be stuck underwater when the batteries run out.</p>

<p>Another member of the open source community, an engineering veteran with decades of experience at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> and <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a>, translates the operator&rsquo;s feedback into code that might drive the next OpenROV user interface.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how open source works at OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Hardware Testing</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/testing-motor-controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Testing new hardware.' title='Testing new hardware.'><span class='caption-text'>Testing new hardware.</span></span>
I offered to leave when the OpenROV team prepared to test some new components. After working in tech for decades, I&rsquo;ve learned to respect a company&rsquo;s right to protect secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that this is all open source,&rdquo; they told me. &ldquo;The schematics are already online, so there&rsquo;s nothing to hide. Come and watch the test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, they had to remind me about the real meaning of open source!</p>

<p>Four OpenROV makers gathered around a tank of water to test a new motor, controller, and propeller combination. They measured power utilization, propulsion, and temperature. Power utilization is important because the batteries need to last. Temperature matters because we don&rsquo;t want the OpenROV to melt underwater (or fry the fish). And propulsion matters because if the unit can&rsquo;t move, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<p>From the reaction of the team, it looks like they found some good components for the next batch of OpenROV kits.</p>

<h3>Strong Minds Coming Together</h3>

<p>The mood in the OpenROV lab is a blend of excitement and technical expertise. Some of the people in the lab are members of the company. Others are adventurers fascinated with this inexpensive, effective way to explore. All are united in the quest to do something awesome with technology.</p>

<p>OpenROV is what we get when the thirst for exploration blends with the open source movement. What a wonderful combination.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-30T17:34:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The current team of <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> organizers assumed leadership in August 2007. Back then, typical monthly attendance was about five people and the group&rsquo;s <a href="http://meetup.com/chicagoruby">Meetup.com</a> database contained 78 members. The previous organizer was swamped with work at his day job, so he handed the baton to a new crew.</p>

<p>Today, the <em>new crew</em> has grown ChicagoRuby to over 2,700 members. The group hosts three meetups every month, and the downtown meetings consistently max out the 100-person RSVP limit. Bonus: ChicagoRuby hosts two conferences, <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> in Chicago and <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> on the Caribbean island of Barbados.</p>

<p>How does ChicagoRuby do it? Through consistency, teamwork, iteration, and learning from mistakes.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Be Consistent With Meetings</h3>

<p>Consistency is very difficult in the beginning, especially on that night when only three people show up for the meeting. I have hosted a 3-person ChicagoRuby meeting before. Consistency is hard, and it is also the most important factor in user group success.</p>

<p>People trust consistency. Consistent meetings grow groups.</p>

<p>Members of ChicagoRuby know that we meet on the first Tuesday of every month downtown, the third Saturday of every month in Elmhurst, and one evening per month for the hack night. Members can plan their schedules months in advance because the ChicagoRuby calendar is consistent. Consistency builds trust.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby cancelled one meeting in January 2011 due to a killer snow storm in Chicago. We were forced to cancel because the property manager shut the entire building down. We&rsquo;re a little bit stubborn about consistency. And that&rsquo;s how we build trust.</p>

<p>Yes, there will be times when the organizer is too exhausted to run an upcoming meeting. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to share the work by building a team.</p>

<h3>Build the Team</h3>

<p>ChicagoRuby believes in sharing the work amongst multiple organizers. The group is stronger with several brains at the helm. Today we have eight organizers. Working as a team enables us to benefit from each other’s strengths. Some organizers have strong design skills, others are strong developers. And some are good at asking members for help.</p>

<h3>Ask for Help</h3>

<blockquote><p>I guarantee you that any favor he asks of you, you will offer to do before he requests it.
<br/>~Tom Hagen, Consigliere</p></blockquote>

<p>One way to ask for help: Encourage members to help in their area of enthusiasm. For example, organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights every month. Ginny got started when she approached the organizers after a meeting and said, &ldquo;We should have hack nights.&rdquo; Clearly, she was enthused about hack nights, so we asked her to take the lead in that area.</p>

<p>Today, Ginny’s hack nights are the highest rated of all ChicagoRuby events. In January, she will be a lab advisor at RubyCaribe.</p>

<p>Before he moved to Florida, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattpolito">Matt Polito</a> was part of the ChicagoRuby organizer team. Matt wanted ChicagoRuby to have a logo. I was against it. We were planning the first WindyCityRails and I wanted everyone to focus on the conference. Matt went out and got the logo done anyway. Everybody likes it. Matt, thank you for ignoring me!</p>

<p>Members who have ideas for improvement tend to be strong leaders. The whole group benefits when we get out of the way and let them lead.</p>

<p>The current members of the ChicagoRuby organizer team are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a>, mentioned above.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a> is a developer and an organizer of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/js-chi/">Chicago JavaScript Meetup Group (JS-Chi)</a>. Justin will also be a lab advisor for RubyCaribe in January 2015.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/hugocorbucci">Hugo Corbucci</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/42800032/">Emily Rosengren</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/135529442/">Sam Jacobs</a> are developers at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. Since ThoughtWorkers travel often, ChicagoRuby always invites two or more to be on the organizer team.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/themccreefiles">Alonda McCree</a> manages the downtown meetups, including logistics and video. Alonda is the conference manager for RubyCaribe.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/1345203/">Marty Lavin</a> manages ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s Elmhurst meetups, including logistics and scheduling. Marty is consistently active in Elmhurst, so we asked him to join the team.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rayhightower">Ray Hightower</a>, author of this
article.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to the core group of ChicagoRuby organizers, one person deserves special mention. <a href="http://twitter.com/zolk">Kevin Zolkiewicz</a> has managed every WindyCityRails since the first one in 2008. Kevin&rsquo;s project management, design, and leadership skills are enjoyed by everyone who attends WindyCityRails.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/about/organizers/">ChicagoRuby Organizer Page</a> contains the list of current and past organizers. Many of the former organizers remain active in an emeritus role. Every mind helps to make the group stronger.</p>

<h3>Automate Everything</h3>

<p>Managing a database of 2,700+ members could be drudgery. Fortunately, <a href="http://meetup.com/chicagoruby">Meetup.com</a> makes the process easy. Meetup handles RSVPs, membership additions and deletions, and reminders. Sometimes, the 2-week automated reminder from Meetup.com reminds the organizers to get a speaker for the next meeting!</p>

<p>Early in our history, someone suggested that ChicagoRuby should not use Meetup.com because it&rsquo;s written in PHP, and we&rsquo;re a Ruby group. We see things differently. ChicagoRuby is a Ruby group that uses the best tool for the job, regardless of language. Meetup.com has proven itself useful for eight years and counting.</p>

<h3>Choose a Short Name</h3>

<p>Growth is an ongoing priority for ChicagoRuby. In order to grow, a group has to attract new members. New members who are looking for a group to join are likely to start with a search engine, and search engines adore simplicity.</p>

<p>Our group was originally called <em>The Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group</em>. Accurate, and a mouthful. We discovered that a simple domain name, <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby.org</a>, was available. So we grabbed it, along with the <a href="http://twitter.com/chicagoruby">@ChicagoRuby</a> Twitter handle.</p>

<h3>Be Easy to Find</h3>

<p>To make the group even easier to find, every web site in the ChicagoRuby ecosystem points to all of the group&rsquo;s other web sites. For example, all of the conference sites point to the ChicagoRuby site, and vice versa. A new member who finds one part of the ecosystem will find the whole thing. People feel welcome when information is easy to find.</p>

<p>Making future members feel welcome is key to growth. Free monthly events are another way to make people feel welcome.</p>

<h3>Keep Monthly Events Free</h3>

<p>I firmly believe that monthly user group meetings should be free. We never know what a member of our community is going through financially. Therefore, ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s monthly meetings have always been free.</p>

<p>My personal history includes times when I was dead broke due to one entrepreneurial setback or another. So I have emotional reasons for keeping ChicagoRuby’s monthly events free of charge.</p>

<p>Of course, the money to pay for the meetings has to come from somewhere. That’s where sponsors can help.</p>

<h3>Cover Monthly Costs Through Sponsorships</h3>

<p>Companies will gladly sponsor a group that gives them a return on their investment. Sponsorships don&rsquo;t always come in the form of money.</p>

<p>For example, ChicagoRuby’s first sponsor was <a href="http://www.deforestgroup.com/">DeForest Group</a>. Owners <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leedeforest">Lee DeForest</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-deforest/40/57a/881">Jim DeForest</a> provide ChicagoRuby with free space and WiFi for our Saturday meetings. Lee was one of the five people in the room when the current organizers took over, and we will always be grateful for his early support.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby’s downtown sponsors are <a href="http://enova.com">Enova</a> and <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. Each company provides space, WiFi, pizza, and beverages on a monthly basis. Sponsors get to address the group at the beginning of the meeting. More important, by sponsoring ChicagoRuby over time, a company can build trust within the membership.</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a> was our first publishing sponsor.  O'Reilly, <a href="http://www.informit.com/user_groups/">Pearson Education</a>, and <a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a> provide books for ChicagoRuby members to <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/book-reviews/">review</a>.</p>

<p>Sponsors get involved with user groups for two main reasons: To recruit developers, or to market products to developers. Everybody wins when sponsors get involved with user groups, financially or otherwise.</p>

<h3>Vet Speakers</h3>

<p>Members of ChicagoRuby trust the organizers to deliver quality events every month. I dropped the ball one month when I failed to properly vet a speaker. After that meeting, organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/dgiunta">Dave Giunta</a> wrote the first draft of the ChicagoRuby <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/about/speaker-guidelines/">speaker guidelines</a>. We&rsquo;ve word-smithed the guidelines over the years, but the most important parts were created by Dave.</p>

<h3>Make Members Feel Awesome</h3>

<p>We humans have a need to belong to something. The feeling of belonging (awesomeness) can be strengthened when we go out for drinks after an event. Drinks are not necessarily alcohol; when we go to a bar together, some members will have a soda, juice, or coffee. Informal camaraderie makes members feel like members.</p>

<p>ChicagoRuby members gather together at a bar for an hour or so after our downtown meetings. In Elmhurst, the meetings end at noon, so we grab lunch together at a local restaurant. The conversation continues, and bonds are formed.</p>

<h3>Maintain Focus, and Explore New Areas</h3>

<p>Focus can lead to excellence. But if our focus is too tight, we might miss the Next Great Thing. How does a group balance between focus and exploration?</p>

<p>Over the years, ChicagoRuby has struggled with focus. We&rsquo;ve experimented with other ventures. We ran a job board for awhile. We ran conferences related to NoSQL and mobile. We moved away from these because they drained our resources, and pulled us away from our core, which is Ruby.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we balance between focus and exploration. The monthly user group meetings are for exploration. Monthly events take minimal resources, so they&rsquo;re ideal for experiments. For example, <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/videos/archives/2013/12/03/ployglot-night/">Polyglot Night</a> in Jan 2014 was very successful. Monthly meetings might explore NoSQL, mobile, or IoT. The Ruby community remains vibrant because we <em>borrow</em> ideas from other communities.</p>

<p>Our conferences focus on Ruby. Conferences require more planning and resources than monthly meetups. So, to maximize efficiency, we build our conferences around our core strength: Ruby. RubyCaribe is the newest example of this focused approach.</p>

<h3>Collaborate With Other Groups</h3>

<p>Collaboration stretches our brains in unexpected and wonderful ways. For our newest ventures, ChicagoRuby is collaborating with developers in the Caribbean, in the island nation of Barbados.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a> is a monthly user group for open source enthusiasts.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> is a brand new conference for intermediate and advanced Ruby developers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Through the new ventures, ChicagoRuby has been introduced to work done by the <a href="https://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/">University of the West Indies at Cave Hill (UWI)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/fst/cmp/staff/colin-depradine.aspx">Dr. Colin Depradine</a>, Dean of the University’s Faculty of Science and Technology, is growing the next generation of scientists and engineers in the Caribbean. Under Dr. Depradine&rsquo;s leadership, UWI encourages collaboration between the sciences. For example, computer scientists are writing software to crunch data related to solar energy research. Looking even further into the future, the UWI team has introduced children as young as eight to programming.</p>

<p>UWI also serves as host to LinuxBarbados. The group is organized by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/143194822/">Maurice Beckles</a>, a Barbados-based open source enthusiast and IT technician at UWI. If you&rsquo;re in Barbados, be sure to ask him about his sink-or-swim introduction to Linux when he worked at a bank!</p>

<p>Notice the pattern: The conference (RubyCaribe) focuses on ChicagoRuby&rsquo;s core strength, Ruby. The monthly user group, LinuxBarbados, is a vehicle for exploring a wide range of topics including Linux, Ruby, embedded devices, and anything related to open source.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A better title for this post might have been <em>One Way to Grow a User Group</em>. Every group will grow differently depending on its particular strengths and interests. Of course, groups that grow are likely to have a few things in common. When a group is built on the pillars of consistency and teamwork, they are likely to succeed in a big way.</p>

<p>Harassment is a serious issue, and a 140-character tweet will not do the discussion justice. Therefore, the ChicagoRuby organizers have created multiple communication channels for this issue:</p>

<li>Email: <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#111;&#x66;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#x64;&#117;&#x63;&#116;&#64;&#99;&#x68;&#x69;&#x63;&#x61;&#103;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x75;&#98;&#121;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x67;">&#x63;&#111;&#100;&#101;&#111;&#102;&#99;&#x6f;&#110;&#100;&#x75;&#99;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x69;&#x63;&#x61;&#x67;&#111;&#114;&#117;&#x62;&#x79;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;</a></li>
<li>Any of the contact names listed on the current code of conduct</li>
<li>Phone number listed on the code of conduct</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have concerns in this area, please feel free to use one of the channels. The contact list may change as responsibilities shift within ChicagoRuby. However, there will always be multiple people available to address harassment concerns.</p>

<p>Thank you Coraline and Liz for your work in making this happen. And thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/lostghost">Ken Walters</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/bradsdeals">Brad’s Deals</a> for facilitating the meeting.</p>

<p>Now, let’s go write some code!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dotfiles, the configuration files used by Unix-like machines, can become disorganized over time. Entropy rules! This article describes my recent attempt to bring order to dotfile chaos. The steps can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the non-private dotfiles (dotfiles that will be viewed by others on Github) into a directory called <code>~/.dotfiles</code>.</li>
<li>From the <code>home</code> directory, create a symbolic link to each dotfile in the <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory.</li>
<li>Use Git to manage the <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory, and share it on GitHub.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dotfiles are normally hidden when you try to view them in the Mac OS X Finder. To view them from the command prompt, use <code>$ ls -al</code>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>```bash
~/.dotfiles[master]$ ls -al
total 40
drwxr-xr-x   8 rth  staff   272 Apr 14 01:44 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 71 rth  staff  2414 Apr 14 02:12 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 rth  staff  3455 Apr 13 16:01 .bash_profile
drwxr-xr-x  14 rth  staff   476 Apr 14 02:25 .git
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash;   1 rth  staff  1649 Apr 13 16:44 .gitk
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash;   1 rth  staff  1760 Apr 13 16:10 .irbrc
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash;   1 rth  staff   118 Aug 22  2013 .zprofile
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash;   1 rth  staff   375 Apr 14 01:44 README.mdown</p>

<p>~/.dotfiles[master]$
```</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile">.bash_profile</a> in this example has grown to include aliases, path specifications, and a script that shows the current Git branch as part of the command prompt. The file also contains two aliases useful for showing or hiding dotfiles in the Finder: <code>showdots</code> and <code>hidedots</code>.</p>

<h3>Putting Dotfiles in One Directory</h3>

<p>Dotfiles are normally created in the user&rsquo;s home directory. For organization purposes, I moved my non-private dotfiles into a directory called <code>.dotfiles</code>, listed above. Unix makes this easy. First, move to the home directory and create <code>~/.dotfiles</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ cd ~</p>

<p>~$ mkdir .dotfiles</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p><em>Note: Dotfiles can sometimes include private information. If you don&rsquo;t want to share information in a particular dotfile, don&rsquo;t put it on GitHub!</em></p>

<p>In this example, we&rsquo;ll only move one file, <code>.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>~$ cd .dotfiles/</p>

<p>$ mv ../.bash_profile .</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Symbolic Links</h3>

<p>Symbolic links ensure that executables can find our dotfiles as needed.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>$ cd ~</p>

<p>$ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile</p>

<p>$ ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x   3 rth  staff   102 Apr 14 19:48 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 73 rth  staff  2482 Apr 14 19:47 ..
lrwxr-xr-x   1 rth  staff    34 Apr 14 19:48 .bash_profile &ndash;> /Users/rth/.dotfiles/.bash_profile</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>In the above example, we created a symbolic link called <code>.bash_profile</code> to the real <code>~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile</code> located in the <code>.dotfiles</code> directory. That way, any program that&rsquo;s looking for the <code>.bash_profile</code> file in the home directory will find what it needs, even though the file is somewhere else.</p>

<h3>Why Use Git to Manage Dotfiles?</h3>

<p>Git is a great tool for managing files that change over time. Dotfiles can change as we install new software or tweak our development environment. If we make a mistake, or if an installation script makes a mistake, we can use Git to roll back in history to a pre-mistake version of the dotfile.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Make All Dotfiles Public</h3>

<p>There are some dotfiles that you don&rsquo;t want to share publicly. For example, <code>.bash_history</code> contains all of the commands that have been executed in the shell. Do you really want the world that you sometimes <code>$ ssh myuserid@[embarassingdomainname].com</code>? Probably not. If you think that a dotfile might contain personal or confidential information, no need to broadcast it.</p>

<h3>Learning More About Dotfiles</h3>

<p>Most of my dotfiles, like <code>.bash_profile</code>, don&rsquo;t contain anything private. In fact, most of what I know about dotfiles has come from other developers via books, user groups, blogs, and spelunking through GitHub. Dotfile collections by <a href="https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix">Hashrocket</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">Thoughtbot</a> are  especially good. My <code>~/.dotfiles</code> directory is available for public viewing on <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/.dotfiles">GitHub</a>.</p>
