    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the early days of robots people said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s build a robot&rsquo; and what&rsquo;s the first thought? You make a robot look like a human and do human things. That&rsquo;s so 1950s. We are so past that.
<br/>~Neil deGrasse Tyson</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov-uw.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.' title='OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV: Underwater robot running Node.js.</span></span>
<a href="http://openrov.com">OpenROV</a> is an underwater robot, roughly the size of a toaster, and definitely not human-shaped. The device is controlled through a Node.js-based web app. Former NASA researcher Eric Stackpole and Make Magazine columnist David Lang are on a mission to democratize ocean exploration in the same way that Jobs and Woz sparked the democratization of  computing. Eric and David pooled their talents to launch OpenROV, building on the foundation laid by Moore’s Law and the open source software movement.</p>

<p>OpenROV&rsquo;s ingredients are an impressive mix of open source goodness&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>BeagleBone Black &ndash; an open-source single-board computer, smaller than a deck of cards, running Linux.</li>
<li>Linux &ndash; specifically, the Ubuntu distribution.</li>
<li>Node.js &ndash; platform for building web applications, based on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. Thanks to Node.js, any laptop running a web browser can control the OpenROV.</li>
<li>Arduino &ndash; inexpensive micro-controller commonly used in robotics projects.</li>
<li>TCP/IP &ndash; the communication protocol of the Internet. TCP/IP handles all communications (commands, video) between the OpenROV and the pilot’s laptop.</li>
</ul>


<p>The OpenROV team has released all of their <a href="https://github.com/openrov">schematics and source code</a> to the open source community, hence the word “open” in the company name. If you think the open source aspects of OpenROV are exciting, wait until you hear about the company&rsquo;s main mission: Underwater exploration.</p>

<p>Eric and David were kind enough to invite me to their lab/manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California recently. Thank you, OpenROV makers!</p>

<h3>Remotely Operated Vehicles</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Laptop, browser, and game controller.' title='Laptop, browser, and game controller.'><span class='caption-text'>Laptop, browser, and game controller.</span></span>
ROV is short for remotely operated vehicle, an underwater robot. Scientists use ROVs to study marine life. Oil companies use ROVs for underwater construction and inspections. Industry-grade ROVs are priced at $30,000 on the low-end, while a <a href="http://www.mbari.org/twenty/Tiburon.htm">custom ROV can cost several million dollars</a>.</p>

<p>The OpenROV team was convinced that they could design and build an ROV small enough to fit in a suitcase, and easy enough for a citizen scientist to assemble and maintain. Targeting the general public meant achieving a relatively low price point: under one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>

<p>They did it. The device is successful, and you can <a href="http://store.openrov.com/">buy an OpenROV</a> kit today for $849.00.</p>

<p>Movements are controlled via a USB-connected video game controller. A Bluetooth-equipped controller should work just as well. Some users will prefer the laptop keyboard; that works too.</p>

<p>In other words, the computer that you’re using to read this article can probably control the OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Citizen Science</h3>

<p>Our world will always need professional scientists, people working in academia and in industry to push the frontier of knowledge. Some scientific problems require the attention of PhD-level professionals, while other problems are better solved through crowdsourcing. Enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen scientist</a>.</p>

<p>Professional scientists are good at analyzing data, because that&rsquo;s what they have trained themselves to do. But data gathering requires less training than analysis. Citizen science and crowdsourcing work when there&rsquo;s an overwhelming volume of data to gather. Or when the breakthrough is beyond the reach of current scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists may be constrained by money, but they tend to be unconstrained by expertise. Therefore they are likely to try solutions that experts would never consider. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">Orville and Wilbur Wright</a> were citizen scientists. Professional scientists pursued solutions for fixed-wing flight prior to the Wright brothers' success. But since the flight problem defied the known science of the day, new approaches were required.</p>

<p>Amusingly, successful citizen scientists can be outwitted by their own expertise, just like the professionals. For example&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris &hellip;[because] no known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping.
<br/>~Orville Wright</p></blockquote>

<p>Shifting back to the 21st century: Thousands of citizen scientists are using OpenROV to explore oceans and lakes more thoroughly than ever before.</p>

<h3>Open Source On-Site</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/ui-discussion-2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.' title='Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.'><span class='caption-text'>Enthusiasts collaborate on the next UI.</span></span>
On the day I visited the OpenROV factory, other underwater enthusiasts were on-site, working with company engineers on product improvements. One enthusiast is a professional pilot of manned submersibles, underwater vehicles large enough to hold people. This pilot has traveled as deep as 2,000 meters below the ocean&rsquo;s surface! &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking at amperage&rdquo;, she said in a discussion with another enthusiast. A spike in amperage could indicate a ground fault, and batteries drain rapidly when that happens. You do not want to be stuck underwater when the batteries run out.</p>

<p>Another member of the open source community, an engineering veteran with decades of experience at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> and <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a>, translates the operator&rsquo;s feedback into code that might drive the next OpenROV user interface.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how open source works at OpenROV.</p>

<h3>Hardware Testing</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/testing-motor-controller.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Testing new hardware.' title='Testing new hardware.'><span class='caption-text'>Testing new hardware.</span></span>
I offered to leave when the OpenROV team prepared to test some new components. After working in tech for decades, I&rsquo;ve learned to respect a company&rsquo;s right to protect secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that this is all open source,&rdquo; they told me. &ldquo;The schematics are already online, so there&rsquo;s nothing to hide. Come and watch the test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, they had to remind me about the real meaning of open source!</p>

<p>Four OpenROV makers gathered around a tank of water to test a new motor, controller, and propeller combination. They measured power utilization, propulsion, and temperature. Power utilization is important because the batteries need to last. Temperature matters because we don&rsquo;t want the OpenROV to melt underwater (or fry the fish). And propulsion matters because if the unit can&rsquo;t move, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<p>From the reaction of the team, it looks like they found some good components for the next batch of OpenROV kits.</p>

<h3>Strong Minds Coming Together</h3>

<p>The mood in the OpenROV lab is a blend of excitement and technical expertise. Some of the people in the lab are members of the company. Others are adventurers fascinated with this inexpensive, effective way to explore. All are united in the quest to do something awesome with technology.</p>

<p>OpenROV is what we get when the thirst for exploration blends with the open source movement. What a wonderful combination.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/06/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-06T02:31:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/06/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/ruby-rails-ubuntu-beaglebone-black.png' width='' height='' alt='Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.' title='Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.'><span class='caption-text'>Ruby. Rails. Ubuntu. BeagleBone Black.</span></span></p>

<p>Part one of this series shows <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black</a>. We used a MacBook Pro to burn an Ubuntu disk image onto an SD card, and then we booted a BeagleBone Black from the image we created.</p>

<p>This post, part two, covers the installation of the Ubuntu GUI, Ruby, and Rails. All of the commands in this article are run on the BeagleBone Black.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> bonus: Rails requires a JavaScript runtime, and Node.js offered the quickest way to fulfill this requirement. Details appear within.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Partition Size</h3>

<p>At the end of <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">part one</a>, we successfully booted the Bone with the Ubuntu command line interface. Now it&rsquo;s time to add the GUI. Two things to know about the Ubuntu GUI installation&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The partition we created on the SD card (in part one) is too small to hold the Ubuntu GUI. Solution: The SD card has some extra room, and we can re-size the partition.</li>
<li>We can install the Ubuntu GUI with a single line command. But it takes an hour for the Bone to download, compile, and install all of the GUI libraries.</li>
</ul>


<p>If we try to install the GUI with insufficient space, the installation will fail midway and we will have wasted half an hour. So it&rsquo;s best to re-size first.</p>

<h3>Doing Our Own Re-Sizing?</h3>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the partition have the right size when we originally downloaded the image file? Good question.</p>

<p>My guess: The image file was designed to be as small as possible in order to minimize download time. That makes sense. I plan to test this theory by creating a new image with a larger partition size and a pre-installed GUI. If the test is successful, results will be posted on this blog. If the mission fails, then the secretary will disavow any knowledge&hellip;</p>

<h3>How to Re-Size the Partition</h3>

<p><code>df</code> is the Unix &lsquo;disk free&rsquo; command. It shows used/available disk space.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ df</p>

<p>Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs           3778576 2722944    885776  76% /
/dev/root        3778576 2722944    885776  76% /
devtmpfs          253580       4    253576   1% /dev
none               50748     608     50140   2% /run

none              253728     204    253524   1% /run/shm

/dev/mmcblk1p2   1748200    2664   1655068   1% /media/rootfs</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p><code>ll</code> is one of the useful aliases built into Ubuntu&rsquo;s <code>.bashrc</code> file. We
can use it to examine the partitions on the SD card.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ ll /dev/mmcblk*</p>

<p>brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  0 Jan  5 15:37 /dev/mmcblk0
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  1 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk0p1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  2 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk0p2
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  8 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 16 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot0
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 24 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  9 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1p1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 10 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1p2</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p><code>fdisk</code> will resize the partition we&rsquo;re after. <code>root</code> priviledges are required to modify the partition table, so we&rsquo;ll use <code>sudo</code>. The standard <a href="/sudo-disclaimer">sudo disclaimer</a> applies.</p>

<p>A few useful <code>fdisk</code> commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>p</code> prints the partition table.</li>
<li><code>d</code> deletes a partition.</li>
<li><code>n</code> creates a new partition.</li>
<li><code>w</code> write new information to the partition table.</li>
<li><code>q</code> quits fdisk.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the plan: In order to increase the size of <code>/dev/mmcblk0p2</code>, we will delete it, and then re-create it with a larger size. Note the use of the <code>d</code> and <code>n</code> commands in the following sequence. When <code>fdisk</code> asks us for the new partition number, type, first sector, and last sector, we will choose the defaults. Choosing the defaults will use all of the available space on the SD card.</p>

<p>Your numbers will vary depending on the size and configuration of your SD card, but the general procedure will be the same.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p>The warning/error message at the end just means that we need reboot the Bone before the partition table takes effect.</p>

<p>Reboot the BeagleBone Black, holding down the boot switch (closest to
the USB port) to ensure that we boot to the system on the SD card
instead of the eMMC.</p>

<p>After the Bone reboots, run <code>resize2fs</code> to expand the partition created above.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
[sudo] password for ubuntu:
resize2fs 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
Filesystem at /dev/mmcblk0p2 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 1
The filesystem on /dev/mmcblk0p2 is now 951424 blocks long.</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p>And now we have enough room to install the Ubuntu GUI.</p>

<h3>Installing the Ubuntu GUI</h3>

<p><em>Update (Feb2014): In the comments below, Jonathan Chan describes how he updated the desktop installation files before installing the Ubuntu desktop. To update the desktop installation files, grab the latest list of packages (<code>update</code>) and then <code>upgrade</code> the packages that need it.</em></p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo apt-get update</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>$ sudo apt-get upgrade</p>

<p>$<br/>
```</p>

<p>After the partition on the SD card has been resized, this command will intall the GUI. The command is short, but the process takes about an hour:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
</code>
When installation and compilation are complete, Ubuntu will return to the command prompt. Here&rsquo;s how to reboot:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo reboot
</code></p>

<p>Several minutes later, the Ubuntu 12 GUI will appear. Congratulations!  Login using the default credentials (login: ubuntu, pw: ubuntu) to get to the Ubuntu desktop.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Running RVM</h3>

<p>I prefer to use the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) for bouncing between Ruby versions. RVM misbehaved, initially. Then I learned something special about RVM&rsquo;s interaction with Ubuntu. From the RVM support pages…</p>

<blockquote><p>For RVM to work properly, you have to set the &lsquo;Run command as login shell&rsquo; checkbox on the Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal&rsquo;s Settings page.</p></blockquote>

<p>This image shows the checkbox mentioned in the quote. It&rsquo;s inside of the lower red rectangle.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/rvm-ubuntu-run-command_as_login-shell.jpg' width='' height='' alt='RVM: Run command as login shell.' title='RVM: Run command as login shell.'><span class='caption-text'>RVM: Run command as login shell.</span></span></p>

<p>Details are in the RVM support article <a href="http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal">Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Ruby Installation</h3>

<p>Ruby installation initially failed (speculation) because the Bone went into power save mode during the installation process. Ruby installed successfully on the second try when I kept the machine awake by moving the mouse. This <em>power save hypothesis</em> has not been thoroughly tested.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Rails Installation</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/nodejs-white.png' width='' height='' alt='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.' title='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.'><span class='caption-text'>Node.js on BeagleBone Black.</span></span>
Rails needs a JavaScript runtime in order to function. Here are two ways to meet this requirement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Node.js, or</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/therubyracer">therubyracer</a> gem.</li>
</ul>


<p>Installing <code>therubyracer</code> did not work for me. But Node.js installed quickly, like so:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
</code></p>

<p>Now that we have a JavaScript runtime, Rails runs successfully.</p>

<p>Side note: If you want to see what a Node.js-equipped Bone can do, check
out <a href="http://openrov.com">OpenROV</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Bottom line: Ruby, Rails, and Ubuntu can run successfully on BeagleBone Black, with Node.js as a bonus.</p>

<p>The BeagleBone Black is a cool option for running Ubuntu. Yes, it runs slower than a typical laptop. But it runs, and at $45 each we can build a cluster of Bones if we&rsquo;re concerned about performance!</p>

<p>What an amazing bundle of technology.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails.jpg' width='' height='' alt='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.' title='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.'><span class='caption-text'>BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.</span></span></p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, and Rails. Why Ubuntu? The Bone comes <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">pre-installed with Ångström</a>, and it boots as soon as you unbox it. Why not stick with Ångström?</p>

<p>My opinion: The factory standard is fine, but it&rsquo;s always good to have options. Here&rsquo;s why I decided to try Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Ubuntu documentation is plentiful. Books, blogs, and videos are readily available.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu community is huge. When a dev runs into an Ubuntu-related snag, it&rsquo;s likely that another dev has encountered a similar problem, and they can collaborate on a solution.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the distro that I&rsquo;m most familiar with. <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> uses Ubuntu for multiple projects. With a common operating system, knowledge gained in one environment is immediately useful in another.</li>
<li>Prepping for <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a>, the 64-core single-board computer that will cost about two hundred bucks. The Parallella is currently in short supply. When it becomes available, it will run Ubuntu. Experience with other single-board computers, especially those running Ubuntu, will prove useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>This article will show how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black. <em>Gotchas</em> will be pointed out along the way. Where possible, I will explain the reasons behind my decisions so that you can make different choices if you like.</p>

<p>For a comparable examination of the Raspberry Pi, take a look at <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Ruby on Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<h3>First Gotcha: Ubuntu 13 on the Bone</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 12 runs well on the BeagleBone Black, but Ubuntu 13 does not. My Ubuntu 13 installation appeared to be successful, but the Ubuntu 13 GUI hung up immediately after login. The Ubuntu 13 command line interface worked fine.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google reveals that others encountered similar roadblocks with version 13. One successful Bone/13 installation was used via SSH, not interactively via keyboard and GUI. Hopefully this will change with future updates. Or, since we&rsquo;re dealing in the open source world, maybe I can pitch in and help.</p>

<p>Due to the issues encountered with version 13, everything in this article will focus on Ubuntu 12.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Installing Ubuntu 12</h3>

<p>In addition to the BeagleBone Black, the following items should be gathered before installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro SD card of at least 8GB. It&rsquo;s possible to perform the installation with a 4GB card, but that won&rsquo;t leave much room for Ubuntu applications.</li>
<li>SD card reader/writer. Recent versions of Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro come with an SD reader/writer built in.</li>
<li>SD to Micro-SD card adapter. The Bone is designed for micro SD, and the MacBook Pro is designed for full-sized SD. Some micro SD packages come with the adapter.</li>
<li>A monitor that accepts HDMI input.</li>
<li>USB keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter. The Bone uses micro HDMI for video output, but your monitor probably uses full-sized HDMI.</li>
<li>External 5V power adapter for the Bone. Personally, I trust the standard 5v power input more than I trust the power provided via USB. One never knows if USB can provide sufficient (and stable) amperage for a circuit board. Power fluctuations can lead to strange behavior, including video flickering.</li>
<li>Ethernet cable with RJ-45 ends.</li>
<li>A fast internet connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>The standard <a href="/sudo-disclaimer">sudo disclaimer</a> applies.</p>

<h3>Homebrew Required</h3>

<p>Homebrew is the easiest way to install &lsquo;nix utilities on Mac OS X. We need Homebrew in order to install some of the utilities needed to burn the SD card. The one-line Homebrew installation command is given on the  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew site</a>.</p>

<p>Each time we use Homebrew, we run <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> to make sure the packages are up-to-date.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run</code>brew update`.</p>

<p>$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from a2e44659 to 4c7bc9ec.</p>

<p>$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```</p>

<h3>The xz Extraction Utility</h3>

<p>Disk image files are downloaded in a compressed format. We need the <code>xz</code> utility in order to extract the files into something usable. If you already have Homebrew installed, this command will install <code>xz</code> for you.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ brew install xz
</code></p>

<h3>Test the BeagleBone Black First</h3>

<p>Power up your BeagleBone Black and make sure it runs with the built-in Ångström Linux installation. One great thing about the Bone is that it will <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">boot to the Ångström GUI</a> straight out of the box, with no prior configuration.</p>

<p>If the GUI boots, then you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>If the GUI doesn&rsquo;t boot, it may have been damaged in a prior experiement. Embarassing note: I started looking for a way to install Ubuntu on the Bone because I broke my Ångström installation. What can I say&hellip; I learn more from destructive experiments. Faced with a non-booting Bone, I had two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-build Ångström.</li>
<li>Try something different, like Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Option two worked well!</p>

<h3>Prep the SD Card</h3>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility is a convenient tool for wiping the SD card.  Standard warnings about any disk utility apply. Double-check everything, and make sure you&rsquo;re wiping the right volume, or you could lose all of your data.</p>

<p>Next, download the Ubuntu 12.04 image from <a href="http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/#precise">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the image using the <code>xz</code> utility.
<code>bash
$ xz ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz
</code></p>

<p>The extracted image will have a <code>.img</code> file extension. We will use the <code>dd</code> utility to burn the disk image to the SD card. But first, we need to determine the designation of the SD card.</p>

<h3>Find the SD Card Designation</h3>

<p>In order to burn the SD card, we need to make sure we target it correctly. Here&rsquo;s how to figure out which device to target.</p>

<p><code>$ diskutil list</code> will show all of the partitions mounted on the system.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk1
</code>
I happen to know that my SD Card is 8.0 GB in capacity, and my system also has a 500 GB SSD. The goal is to burn the SD card while leaving the 500 GB SSD (home of the Mac OS X operating system and all of my data) intact. From the <code>$ diskutil list</code> report, I can see that the SD card&rsquo;s designation <em>in my system</em> is <code>/dev/disk1</code>.</p>

<p>Note the italicized words <em>in my system</em>. Your system is probably different, especially if you have a DVD drive or a second hard drive. I have neither of those. The SD card&rsquo;s designation will be different in each system where it is mounted depending on the number and location of the drives that are already there.</p>

<p>Now that we know the SD card&rsquo;s designation, we can unmount it. We unmount the drive (but leave the card inserted in the reader) so that it can be written with the Ubuntu disk image.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful
</code></p>

<p>Looks like the SD card was unmounted successfully. Now we can write the
Ubuntu image with the <code>dd</code> utility.</p>

<h3>Writing the Ubuntu Image</h3>

<p>The following command will write the decompressed Ubuntu image to the SD
card.</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo dd bs=1m if=ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img of=/dev/disk1</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note that it may take up to an hour for the image to be written.</p>

<p>One drawback of using the command line is that there is no gauge to tell you how much progress the utility is making. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a way to measure progress at <a href="http://elinux.org">eLinux.org</a>. While the command line utility is running, and while that window has focus, type <code>control-T</code>. A few seconds later, the terminal window will show a brief activity report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a report from the first time I struck <code>control-T</code> &hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
load: 2.03  cmd: dd 75608 uninterruptible 0.00u 0.54s
40+0 records in
39+0 records out
</code></p>

<p>We can strike <code>control-T</code> again to receive additional updates. The numbers will tell us if we are making progress. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with <code>control-T</code>. A watched pot never boils :&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Booting with the New SD Card</h3>

<p>The terminal will return to the command prompt after the Ubuntu image has been written to the SD card. Now it&rsquo;s time to boot with the new image.</p>

<ol>
<li>Eject the SD card from the Mac.</li>
<li>Remove power from the BeagleBone Black, and insert the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Note the location of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; button on the Bone. It&rsquo;s the micro switch closest to the USB port. We will need to hold this switch down while powering up the Bone.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few notes about item #3. It takes some juggling to hold down a micro switch while plugging in power to the board. I found it easier to plug the power adapter into a powered-off surge suppressor, hold down the microswitch, and then power-on the surge suppressor with my elbow.  Sounds ridiculous, but it worked.</p>

<p>About sixty seconds after boot, the Linux penguin appeared in the upper left corner of the Bone display. And then the login prompt appeared.</p>

<p>Another note about the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; switch: It looks like the Bone will boot into the SD&rsquo;s operating system (instead of the eMMC flash OS where Angstrom resides) without the micro switch if the switch was used in the previous boot. I haven&rsquo;t rebooted enough times to test this thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Default Credentials for Ubuntu on BeagleBone Black</h3>

<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default BeagleBone Black login credentials are shown here because I always end up hunting for these when I need them. It&rsquo;s much easier to have information at one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<p><code>bash
login: ubuntu
pw: ubuntu
</code></p>

    <updated>2013-11-10T23:05:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/10/a-portable-hack-for-parallella</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/parallella-portable.png' width='' height='' alt='Portability for Parallella-sized devices.' title='Portability for Parallella-sized devices.'><span class='caption-text'>Portability for Parallella-sized devices.</span></span>
<a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a> are three small, powerful Linux-based computers. But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.</p>

<h3>Inspiration in a Suitcase</h3>

<p>The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my <em>regular work</em> faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent time learning assembler with the HP 5036.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/hp-5036.png' width='' height='' alt='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab' title='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab'><span class='caption-text'>HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab</span></span></p>

<p>The entire 5036 fits in a suitcase&hellip; how cool is that! Here&rsquo;s how the 5036 works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing assembler-level code by hand on paper.</li>
<li>Grab the reference book for the microprocessor running on the
board, Intel 8080.</li>
<li>For each assembler-level command, find the corresponding 2-digit
hexidecimal operation code.</li>
<li>Key the op code into the 5036 by hand.</li>
<li>Run the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Working with the 5036 was addictive in a positive way. In a subsequent job, where I wrote assembler to drive hardware devices, I was ready.</p>

<h3>Portability Needed</h3>

<p>Fast forward a few decades. We now have the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella. Wonderful devices with one flaw in common: No portability. That&rsquo;s when I had a flashback to my days with the 5036.</p>

<p>I bought a $35 technician box from Home Depot and I ripped out the insides. Micro Center had 720p LCD monitors on sale for $90, so I bought one of those. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the extra bucks for a 1080p LCD because you never know how something like this might work out! Finally, I topped everything off with a $25 keyboard/trackpad combo from Amazon.  The result appears in the photo at the top of this article. Special thanks to Ericka [last name unknown] from Home Depot who gave me tons of ideas on how to securely fasten the monitor to the case.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why did I spend the time and money to assemble this kit? It&rsquo;s all about learning. Devs learn more when we interact with other devs &ndash; people who are learning some of the same things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with. And sometimes the things we need to learn are too new for books.</p>

<p>By carrying my Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella with me in a portable unit, I can share my experiences with other devs and learn more in the process. Everybody wins when that happens.</p>

<h3>Thanks SCNA!</h3>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA)</a> gave me the opportunity to present this story as a lightning talk at the conference. Slides are here:</p>

<p>Thank you SCNA! As I shared with the other devs at SCNA, I will gladly post my mistakes and <em>gotchas</em> here for people who want to build a unit like this. Let&rsquo;s build!</p>
