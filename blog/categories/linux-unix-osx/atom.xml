    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails.jpg' width='' height='' alt='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.' title='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.'><span class='caption-text'>BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.</span></span></p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, and Rails. Why Ubuntu? The Bone comes pre-installed with <a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/">Ångström</a>. Why not stick with Ångström?</p>

<p>My opinion: The factory standard is fine, but it&rsquo;s always good to have options. Here&rsquo;s why I decided to try Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu documentation is plentiful. Books, blogs, and videos are readily available.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu community is huge. When a dev runs into an Ubuntu-related snag, it&rsquo;s likely that another dev has encountered a similar problem, and they can collaborate on a solution.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the distro that I&rsquo;m most familiar with. <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> uses Ubuntu for multiple projects. With a common operating system, knowledge gained in one environment is immediately useful in another.</li>
<li>Prepping for <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a>, the 64-core single-board computer that will cost about two hundred bucks. The Parallella is currently in short supply. When it becomes available, it will run Ubuntu. Experience with other single-board computers, especially those running Ubuntu, will prove useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>This article will show how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black. <em>Gotchas</em> will be pointed out along the way. Where possible, I will explain the reasons behind my decisions so that you can make different choices if you like.</p>

<p>For a comparable examination of the Raspberry Pi, take a look at <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Ruby on Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<h3>Sudo Disclaimer: You Could Destroy Everything</h3>

<p>Procedures described here will ask you to use the <code>sudo</code> command. <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">Sudo endows users with great power</a>. You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using <code>sudo</code> incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date by the time you read this. Please be careful, and double-check these steps through your own sources.</p>

<h3>First Gotcha: Ubuntu 13 on the Bone</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 12 runs well on the BeagleBone Black, but Ubuntu 13 does not. My Ubuntu 13 installation appeared to be successful, but the Ubuntu 13 GUI hung up immediately after login. The Ubuntu 13 command line interface worked fine.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google reveals that others encountered similar roadblocks with version 13. One successful Bone/13 installation was used via SSH, not interactively via keyboard and GUI. Hopefully this will change with future updates. Or, since we&rsquo;re dealing in the open source world, maybe I can pitch in and help.</p>

<p>Due to the issues encountered with version 13, everything in this article will focus on Ubuntu 12.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Installing Ubuntu 12</h3>

<p>In addition to the BeagleBone Black, the following items should be gathered before installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro SD card of at least 8GB. It&rsquo;s possible to perform the installation with a 4GB card, but that won&rsquo;t leave much room for Ubuntu applications.</li>
<li>SD card reader/writer. Recent versions of Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro come with an SD reader/writer built in.</li>
<li>SD to Micro-SD card adapter. The Bone is designed for micro SD, and the MacBook Pro is designed for full-sized SD. Some micro SD packages come with the adapter.</li>
<li>A monitor that accepts HDMI input.</li>
<li>Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter. The Bone uses micro HDMI for video output, but your monitor probably uses full-sized HDMI.</li>
<li>External 5V power adapter for the Bone. Personally, I trust the standard 5v power input more than I trust the power provided via USB. One never knows if USB can provide sufficient (and stable) amperage for a circuit board. Power fluctuations can lead to strange behavior, including video flickering.</li>
<li>Ethernet cable with RJ-45 ends.</li>
<li>A fast internet connection.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hombrew Required</h3>

<p>Homebrew is the easiest way to install &lsquo;nix utilities on Mac OS X. We need Homebrew in order to install some of the utilities needed to burn the SD card. The one-line Homebrew installation command is given on the  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew site</a>.</p>

<p>Each time we use Homebrew, we run <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> to make sure the packages are up-to-date.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run</code>brew update`.</p>

<p>$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from a2e44659 to 4c7bc9ec.</p>

<p>$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```</p>

<h3>The xz Extraction Utility</h3>

<p>Disk image files are downloaded in a compressed format. We need the <code>xz</code> utility in order to extract the files into something usable. If you already have Homebrew installed, this command will install <code>xz</code> for you.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ brew install xz
</code></p>

<h3>Test the BeagleBone Black First</h3>

<p>Power up your BeagleBone Black and make sure it runs with the built-in Ångström Linux installation. One great thing about the Bone is that it will <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">boot to the Ångström GUI</a> straight out of the box, with no prior configuration.</p>

<p>If the GUI boots, then you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>If the GUI doesn&rsquo;t boot, it may have been damaged in a prior experiement. Embarassing note: I started looking for a way to install Ubuntu on the Bone because I broke my Ångström installation. What can I say&hellip; I learn more from destructive experiments. Faced with a non-booting Bone, I had two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-build Ångström.</li>
<li>Try something different, like Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Option two worked well!</p>

<h3>Prep the SD Card</h3>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility is a convenient tool for wiping the SD card.  Standard warnings about any disk utility apply. Double-check everything, and make sure you&rsquo;re wiping the right volume, or you could lose all of your data.</p>

<p>Next, download the Ubuntu 12.04 image from <a href="http://s3.armhf.com/debian/precise/bone/ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the image using the <code>xz</code> utility.
<code>bash
$ xz ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz
</code></p>

<p>The extracted image will have a <code>.img</code> file extension. We will use the <code>dd</code> utility to burn the disk image to the SD card. But first, we need to determine the designation of the SD card.</p>

<p>Additional details for all of the above are at <a href="http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/#precise">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Find the SD Card Designation</h3>

<p>In order to burn the SD card, we need to make sure we target it correctly. Here&rsquo;s how to figure out which device to target.</p>

<p><code>$ diskutil list</code> will show all of the partitions mounted on the system.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk1
</code>
I happen to know that my SD Card is 8.0 GB in capacity, and my system also has a 500 GB SSD. The goal is to burn the SD card while leaving the 500 GB SSD (home of the Mac OS X operating system and all of my data) intact. From the <code>$ diskutil list</code> report, I can see that the SD card&rsquo;s designation <em>in my system</em> is <code>/dev/disk1</code>.</p>

<p>Note the italicized words <em>in my system</em>. Your system is probably different, especially if you have a DVD drive or a second hard drive. I have neither of those. The SD card&rsquo;s designation will be different in each system where it is mounted depending on the number and location of the drives that are already there.</p>

<p>Now that we know the SD card&rsquo;s designation, we can unmount it. We unmount the drive (but leave the card inserted in the reader) so that it can be written with the Ubuntu disk image.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful
</code></p>

<p>Looks like the SD card was unmounted successfully. Now we can write the
Ubuntu image with the <code>dd</code> utility.</p>

<h3>Writing the Ubuntu Image</h3>

<p>The following command will write the decompressed Ubuntu image to the SD
card.</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo dd bs=1m if=ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img of=/dev/disk1</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note that it may take up to an hour for the image to be written.</p>

<p>One drawback of using the command line is that there is no gauge to tell you how much progress the utility is making. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a way to measure progress at <a href="http://elinux.org">eLinux.org</a>. While the command line utility is running, and while that window has focus, type <code>control-T</code>. A few seconds later, the terminal window will show a brief activity report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a report from the first time I struck <code>Control-T</code> &hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
load: 2.03  cmd: dd 75608 uninterruptible 0.00u 0.54s
40+0 records in
39+0 records out
</code></p>

<p>We can strike <code>Control-T</code> again to receive additional updates. The numbers will tell us if we are making progress. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with <code>Control-T</code>. A watched pot never boils :&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Booting with the New SD Card</h3>

<p>The terminal will return to the command prompt after the Ubuntu image has been written to the SD card. Now it&rsquo;s time to boot with the new image.</p>

<ol>
<li>Eject the SD card from the Mac.</li>
<li>Remove power from the BeagleBone Black, and insert the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Note the location of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; button on the Bone. It&rsquo;s the micro switch closest to the USB port. We will need to hold this switch down while powering up the Bone.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few notes about item #3. It takes some juggling to hold down a micro switch while plugging in power to the board. I found it easier to plug the power adapter into a powered-off surge suppressor, hold down the microswitch, and then power-on the surge suppressor with my elbow.  Sounds ridiculous, but it worked.</p>

<p>About sixty seconds after boot, the Linux penguin appeared in the upper left corner of the Bone display. And then the login prompt appeared.</p>

<p>Another note about the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; switch: It looks like the Bone will boot into the SD&rsquo;s operating system without the micro switch if the switch was used in the previous boot. I havn&rsquo;t rebooted enough times to test this, yet.</p>

<h3>Default Credentials for Ubuntu on BeagleBone Black</h3>

<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default BeagleBone Black login credentials are shown here because I always end up hunting for these when I need them. It&rsquo;s much easier to have information at one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<p><code>bash
login: ubuntu
pw: ubuntu
</code></p>

<h3>End of Part One</h3>

<p>This marks the end of part one of this post about BeagleBone Black and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Part two will cover&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting the GUI running, including a disk resizing <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
<li>Installing Ruby, including an RVM <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
<li>Installing Rails, and how to handle a JavaScript runtime <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Stay tuned!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/11/os-x-and-rubymotion-finishing-up/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-11T19:03:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/11/os-x-and-rubymotion-finishing-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/show-package-contents.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
There is something I neglected to cover in a previous blog post, <a href="/blog/2013/11/01/building-an-os-x-app-with-rubymotion/">Building an OS X App With RubyMotion</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve written the OS X app, where do you find the executable, and how do you add it to the <code>Applications</code> folder on the Mac?</p>

<p>Long-time Mac enthusiasts may already know how to do this. The information is included here for completeness.</p>

<h3>Find, Drag, and Drop</h3>

<p>First thing to note: A Mac app named [random-app].app is actually a directory, even though it appears to be a file when viewed in the <code>Applications</code> folder. If you&rsquo;re curious, right-click on any app in the <code>Applications</code> folder and choose <code>Show Package Contents</code> from the speed menu.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After compilation, RubyMotion puts all of the executables in the app&rsquo;s <code>build/</code> directory. Using Finder, drag the folder named <code>[your-app-name].app</code> into the <code>Applications</code> folder.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the command line…</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd [root-directory-of-your-app]
$ cp build/MacOSX-10.8-Development/[your-app-name].app /Applications
$
</code></p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether we copy the file or move it.  RubyMotion creates a new one with every build, when we type <code>rake</code>.</p>

<h3>Launch at Login</h3>

<p>I want the EjectDisks utility to be always available, so it would be good to have it launch automatically at login. That behavior is managed in the <code>Users and Groups</code> preference pane, shown below:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/launch-at-login.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span></p>

<p>Click the <code>+</code> sign, navigate to the app you want to launch at login time (in this case, EjectDisks) and select it. Done.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T12:58:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella.jpg" width="450" height="257" alt="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" title="Parallella 64-core supercomputer" align="right" imgcap="Parallella Board">
The idea of owning a 64-core parallel system for two hundred dollars (yes, $200.00) is exciting. <a href="http://www.parallella.org/introduction/">Parallella</a> is working to make that happen, perhaps as early as August 2013. To prepare for that day, I&rsquo;ve decided to introduce myself to the Go language.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What is Go?</h3>

<p><a href="http://golang.org">The Go language</a> is designed for parallel systems. Why does Go exist? One developer sums it up this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go was created at Google, by Google, for Google-size problems.<br/>~Dave Astels</p></blockquote>

<p>Google writes software that runs on thousands of machines in parallel. As the number of concurrent operations increases, new challenges are encountered. Google addressed those challenges by creating Go.</p>

<h3>Why Does a Rubyist Learn Go?</h3>

<p>The team at <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> writes web and mobile apps, mainly in Ruby. So why am I learning Go?</p>

<p>Because the best developers are polyglot. When we learn a new language, we cause ourselves to see old problems in new ways and we strengthen our ability to solve new problems. It&rsquo;s like cross-training for  athletes. In the end, we become better developers.</p>

<h3>How to Install Go on Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list">Download the binary of Go that matches your system</a> <i>but don't install it yet</i>. You will need to complete the rest of these steps before installation. For my 2010 i5-based 15-inch MacBook Pro, I chose <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>. I was concerned about the reference to <code>amd64</code> in the name. But the description includes <code>Mac OS X (x86 64-bit)</code>, and the binary worked for me.</li>
<br/>
<li>If you are upgrading from a previous version of Go, you will need to remove the old Go directory. You can do this while the new binary is downloading in the background:</li>

```bash
$ rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

<li>Define the <code>GOROOT</code> and <code>GOPATH</code> environmental variables. My system uses <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to define environmental variables, so I added the following lines to the end of that file:

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
export GOPATH=~/Code/gocode
```
Note: I'm using the default <code>GOROOT</code> variable, but your <code>GOPATH</code> may differ from mine. I store all of my source code in a subdirectory of home:<code>~/Code</code>. My complete Go directory structure is given below. By looking at my structure, you can adjust these steps to fit your system.</li>
<br/>
<li>Tell your terminal session to recognize the new environmental variables. You can either restart terminal, or if your environmental variables are in <code>~/.bash_profile</code> like mine, you can do the following:</li>

```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
<li>Run the package installation program, <code>go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg</code>, that was downloaded in Step 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, let&rsquo;s Go for a test drive.</p>

<h3>Creating a Go Workspace</h3>

<p>Before you can run a Go program on your system, you have to create a Go workspace. A workspace is a directory structure that contains source code and binaries that a Go program needs in order to compile and execute.</p>

<p>We can examine the Go Workspace on my system with the Unix <code>tree</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode$ tree
.
└── src</p>

<pre><code>└── github.com
    └── rayhightower
        └── hello
            └── hello.go
</code></pre>

<p>4 directories, 1 file</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode$
```</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief description of the directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code = root directory for all source code on my system. Yours may differ.</li>
<li>gocode = where I store all of the Go code on my system. I&rsquo;m following the structure recommended by the Go documentation. I may alter this as I learn more about the language.</li>
<li>src = source code</li>
<li>github.com = directory named after the place where I store repos</li>
<li>rayhightower = my GitHub profile name</li>
<li>hello = directory named for our first Go application</li>
<li>hello.go = the Go source file for our <code>Hello World</code> program</li>
</ul>


<p>All structure below the <code>gocode</code> directory is mandated by Go.</p>

<h3>Writing &lsquo;Hello World!&rsquo; in Go</h3>

<p>Google&rsquo;s official installation instructions include a simple &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; program for testing the installation. A slightly modified version appears below:</p>

<p>```go
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Printf("\n****** Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! ******\n")
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Compiling and Running</h3>

<p>We drop the code into a file called <code>hello.go</code> in the <code>hello</code> directory. To compile the program:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$ go install</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$
<code>``
If the Go compiler responds with a blank prompt (like above) then the program compiled successfully and a</code>bin<code>directory has been created inside the Go workspace. Run the</code>tree<code>command from the</code>gocode` directory to see how the structure has changed:</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode$ tree
.
├── bin
│   └── hello
└── src</p>

<pre><code>└── github.com
    └── rayhightower
        └── hello
            └── hello.go
</code></pre>

<p>5 directories, 2 files</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode$
```</p>

<p>The newly created <code>bin/</code> directory contains our <code>hello</code> executable. And now, let&rsquo;s cut the suspense and <em>run the program</em>. To do so, change into the <code>bin/</code> directory and type <code>./hello</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
~/Code/gocode/src/github.com/rayhightower/hello$ cd ~/Code/gocode/bin</p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/bin$ ./hello</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong> Hey Parallella enthusiasts: Learn Go! </strong></strong></strong></p>

<p>~/Code/gocode/bin$
```
Success!</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s Not Official, But It Makes Sense</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Parallella does not officially support the Go language. So why go through all of this trouble? Because&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>A 64-core Parallella is just too cool to pass up. And it&rsquo;s open source.</li>
<li>Go is designed for parallel systems. And it&rsquo;s open source.</li>
<li>Open source devs are working on a Go compiler for Parallella right now. If you&rsquo;re reading this, and you&rsquo;re one of the devs, thank you!</li>
</ul>


<p>The Go-Parallella match makes sense. It&rsquo;s always good to skate where the puck is going.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to explore the Go language. The real adventure begins when the 64-core Parallella arrives. Looking forward to it!</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I was inspired to explore Go by <a href="https://twitter.com/blakesmith">Blake Smith&rsquo;s</a> presentation at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoSC/events/120658422/">8th Light</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a> introduced me to Parallella last month at ChicagoRuby.</p>

<a href="http://getbraintree.com">Braintree</a> hosted a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/braintreepayments/events/119511632/">Hax &lsquo;n Snax</a> event this afternoon. Devs from around Chicago gathered together to hack on code, socialize, trade ideas, and hone skills. Thanks Braintree for putting on a great event.</p>

<p>My Hax &lsquo;n Snax time was spent interacting with other devs and experimenting with a Linux distro that I just discovered, Kali Linux.</p>

<h3>What is Kali Linux?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali</a> is a fairly new Linux distro designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.

<h3>Parallels Installation Gotcha</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m running Kali Linux inside of Parallels version 7 on Mac OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion). The Linux installation proceeded normally, but when I rebooted the virtual machine, Linux wouldn&rsquo;t come up. Instead, I got the perpetual display of timeouts shown below.</p>

<p>Google led me to a solution on a blog called <a href="http://redrise.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/installing-kali-in-parallels-desktop-7/">redrise</a>. The solution: To make Kali run on Parallels, uncheck the check box labeled &ldquo;Show battery in Linux&rdquo;, as shown below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why a battery indicator would prevent Kali from booting in Parallels, but the solution worked. When I installed Kali on VMWare, the OS ran without special configuration changes.</p>

<h3>The Kali Linux Tools</h3>

<p>Kali comes with over 300 penetration tools. It&rsquo;s open source, so if you see room for improvement, <a href="http://git.kali.org/gitweb/">fork the repo</a> and go to work. If your ideas are strong enough, the developers might accept your pull request. There&rsquo;s even a version of Kali for <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Take a look at the GUI.</p>

<h3>Using Wireshark on Kali Linux</h3>

<p>Kali includes sniffer tools that can capture WiFi traffic. If the WiFi traffic is &ldquo;protected&rdquo; (note the quotes) with an older method like wireless encryption protocol (WEP), Kali&rsquo;s tools can crack the encryption.</p>

<p>A screenshot from Wireshark appears above. Wireshark sits and observes network traffic. If a packet looks interesting, drill down to discover the packet&rsquo;s source, destination, and contents.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Kali enables developers and network professionals to protect themselves and their clients from attacks. Kali is powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">Ack</a> is an open source command line tool that lets developers search large trees of source code very quickly. If you are looking for a method definition in a haystack of files, Ack will find that needle for you. Many devs regard Ack as a replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>.</p>

<p>The Elmhurst <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> meetings are always a source of unexpected learning. Today ChicagoRuby welcomed <a href="http://twitter.com/petdance">Andy Lester</a>, creator of Ack. Andy released Ack 2.0 two days ago. He shared some of the latest features in an impromptu demo.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Why Ack?</h4>

<p>Have you ever been working on a project, only to be interrupted when you need to look for something? It could be a method name, a variable declaration, or a string of text in a comment. A minor distraction costs you the time it takes to search plus the time required to re-focus.</p>

<p>All of us are more productive when we stay <em>in the zone</em>. Ack helps devs to maintain focus and thereby produce better results.</p>

<h4>First, Install Perl</h4>

<p>Ack requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> programming language. Perl comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and most Linux distros. If you&rsquo;re running on a &lsquo;nix platform, you probably have Perl already.</p>

<p>Windows installations are beyond the scope of this article. If you&rsquo;re running Windows, you might consider a Linux VM for Ruby and Rails-related work.</p>

<h4>Installing Ack on Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Installing Ack is so easy that it almost feels wrong: Grab Ack in a single Perl file and drop it in your <code>~/bin/</code> directory. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Ack can also be installed via <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, but I prefer the <em>drop it in ~/bin</em> installation since everything is contained in one file. Here&rsquo;s a more detailed version of the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have one already, create <code>~/bin/</code> as a subdirectory of your home directory.</li>
<li>Grab a the single-file copy of Ack from <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">http://beyondgrep.com/ </a></li>
<li>Drop the single-file copy of Ack into a file called <code>~/bin/ack</code></li>
<li>Make sure that <code>$HOME/bin:</code> appears at the beginning of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ol>


<p>At this point you should be running Ack v2.0 or later. To verify:</p>

<p>```bash
~/bin$ ack &mdash;version
ack 2.02 (git commit f3c8827)
Running under Perl 5.12.4 at /usr/bin/perl</p>

<p>Copyright 2005-2013 Andy Lester.</p>

<p>This program is free software.  You may modify or distribute it
under the terms of the Artistic License v2.0.</p>

<p>~/bin$
```</p>

<p>Installation complete. Now, let&rsquo;s take Ack for a spin.</p>

<h4>Using Ack at the Command Line</h4>

<p>For a sample project, let&rsquo;s use <code>demo_app</code> from Michael Hartl&rsquo;s <a href="http://rubyonrailstutorial.com">Ruby on
Rails Tutorial</a>. Imagine that you want
to find every file in the project that references <code>user_id</code>. How would
you do that?
<img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ack_user_id.png" align="center" height="650" width="887" alt="Ack command line demo" title="Ack command line demo"></p>

<p>Fast, clear, and highlighted in color. Bonus: If you&rsquo;re a Vim user,
try <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">ack.vim</a> if you want to run Ack
without leaving your editor.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Ack helps devs to find things quicker without leaving the zone. Try it!</p>
