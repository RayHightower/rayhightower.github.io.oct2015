Parallella is a single-board supercomputer smaller than a deck of cards. While today’s fastest laptops contain four processor cores, Parallella has <em>eighteen</em> (2 <a href="http://arm.com/">ARM</a> cores plus an <a href="http://www.adapteva.com/epiphanyiii/">Epiphany</a> chip with 16 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing">RISC</a> cores). The maker of Parallella, <a href="http://adapteva.com">Adapteva</a>, is on a mission to democratize parallel computing. The company&rsquo;s tag line is <em>Supercomputing for Everyone</em>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Everything in this post is based on the <a href="http://www.parallella.org/quick-start/">official quick start guide created by the Parallella team</a>. These instructions are tailored for a Mac running OS X Mavericks (10.9.3) and a Parallella-16 equipped with the Zynq 7010 chip. I ran into some <em>gotchas</em> during my first Parallella experience. The snags (and solutions) are documented here.</p>

<h3>Tools Required</h3>

<p>You will need the following items in order to burn an SD card for your
Parallella:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro-SD card, 16GB or greater.</li>
<li>Desktop or laptop computer with a micro-SD card reader, or an SD-card reader with a micro adapter. These instructions are tailored for a Mac. A Linux or Windows machine will work with minor modifications in the procedure.</li>
<li>High-speed internet connection, for downloading Parallella&rsquo;s Ubuntu
image and related files.</li>
<li>Micro-USB-to-USB adapter, for the keyboard and mouse. Parallella is equipped with two micro-USB ports.</li>
<li>Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable or adapter.</li>
<li>Parallella (of course!)</li>
</ul>


<p>Adapteva sells an accessories kit containing an SD card, power adapter, micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, and USB-to-micro-USB adapter. Unless you already have these items, buying the kit may save you time.</p>

<h3>These Steps Could Break Your Primary Machine</h3>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re experimenting with Parallella, we can assume that you are an advanced user. Your computer is already backed up, or you&rsquo;re running these steps on a test machine. And you know <a href="/sudo-disclaimer/">the power and pitfalls of sudo</a>. Technology evolves rapidly, and everything you read here could change by the time you read it.</p>

<h3>Comparison with Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/parallella_fan.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Bits get hot. Use a fan.' title='Bits get hot. Use a fan.'><span class='caption-text'>Bits get hot. Use a fan.</span></span>
How does the Parallella compare with other single-board computers, like the <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">Beaglebone Black</a>? The first difference noticed at boot-time: Parallella runs hot! So hot, in fact, that the unit comes with a heat sink and the recommendation to add a fan. I’ve never needed a fan with a Pi or a ‘Bone.</p>

<p>Of course, the Parallella runs hotter because it has more processing power packed tightly together in limited space. Since Parallella is designed to run tasks in parallel, we can expect certain programs to perform faster than they would on the Pi or &lsquo;Bone. Future posts will explore Parallella&rsquo;s performance using languages designed for concurrency, languages like <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Go</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/02/06/installing-rubinius-using-rvm/">Rubinius</a>. Now, let’s get started with Parallella.</p>

<h3>Getting the Parallella OS</h3>

<p>Parallella runs a customized version of Ubuntu installed on a micro-SD card. Burning the SD card takes a long time, so it makes sense to start that process first.</p>

<p>Download the files that you will need to burn onto the SD card. I&rsquo;m running Mac OS X on my primary machine, and I&rsquo;m configuring a Parallella-16 with a Zynq 7010 and an HDMI display. Therefore, the files needed for this configuration are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://downloads.parallella.org/ubuntu/dists/trusty/image/ubuntu-14.04-140611.img.gz">Ubuntu 14.04 for Parallella</a> (released June 11, 2014)</li>
<li><a href="http://downloads.parallella.org/boot/linux/kernel-hdmi-default.tgz">Linux kernel with HDMI support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/parallella/parallella-hw/blob/master/fpga/bitstreams/parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin?raw=true">Parallella-16 Zynq 7010 with HDMI display</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Unzip the files and place them in a directory that&rsquo;s handy. You&rsquo;ll need them for the next step. With Mac OS X, you can unzip the files by double-clicking them in <code>Finder</code>.</p>

<p>Note: You might need different files depending on the current date (Parallella software is in a rapid state of flux) and your exact equipment. If your configuration is different, you can make the adjustments described in Parallella&rsquo;s official guide.</p>

<h3>Burn the SD Card</h3>

<p>Insert your SD card into your Mac&rsquo;s SD card reader, and use the Mac OS X <code>diskutil list</code> command to determine the designation of the SD card. If you use portable hard drives with your primary machine, the SD card designation could change from time to time, so it&rsquo;s important to perform this step each time you burn a card.</p>

<p>```bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        <em>500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS MacSSD                  499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                       </em>15.9 GB     disk1
   1:               Windows_NTFS Untitled 1             15.9 GB     disk1s1</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>From this <code>diskutil</code> report, we can see that we want to burn the SD image to <code>/dev/disk1</code>. The other device is the hard drive for my primary machine. Burning the wrong device means destroying data.</p>

<p>To burn the SD card&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Change into the directory where you downloaded the Ubuntu image.</li>
<li>Unmount the destination partition on the SD card.</li>
<li>Use the the <code>dd</code> command to copy the Ubuntu image to the SD card.</li>
</ol>


<p>To execute the above steps as <code>bash</code> commands, do the following:</p>

<p>```bash
$ cd [directory containing the ubuntu image file]</p>

<p>$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1</p>

<p>$ sudo dd if=ubuntu-14.04-140611.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=64k
Password:
```</p>

<p>The <code>dd</code> command takes a <em>long</em> time to run, over 56 minutes on my machine. Here&rsquo;s a quick run-through of the command options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sudo</code> gives you <a href="/sudo-disclaimer/">super powers</a>.</li>
<li><code>dd</code> is the &ldquo;copy and convert&rdquo; command. The letters &ldquo;dd&rdquo; have nothing to do with what the tool actually does. It&rsquo;s just a command name. And like so many things in computer science, the name might be based on a pun.</li>
<li><code>if=</code> specifies the input file. You can include the full path, or if the file is in your current directory, you can omit the path as shown in this example.</li>
<li><code>of=</code> specifies the output file. We know that the SD card is located at <code>/dev/disk</code> so that&rsquo;s where the results of this command are headed.  Note that your destination directory may differ from this one.</li>
<li><code>bs=</code> specifies the block size used for the destination file.</li>
</ul>


<h3>About Block Size</h3>

<p>The Mac section of the official Parallella guide recommends a block size of size of 1 megabyte, while the Linux instructions recommend 64 kilobytes (the option <code>bs=64k</code> in the <code>dd</code> command). I initially used <code>bs=1m</code> on my Mac, and I ran into problems. When I used <code>bs=64k</code>, everything worked fine. Note that I eventually traced my problem to something other than block size (details below) but since the 64k setting still works, I&rsquo;ve left it intact. If I find out why Linux and OS X are using different block sizes, I&rsquo;ll post the information here.</p>

<h3>Checking dd Progress</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/dd_progress.png' width='' height='' alt='Activity Monitor' title='Activity Monitor'><span class='caption-text'>Activity Monitor</span></span>
Waiting an hour for the <code>dd</code> command to run can be disconcerting because the machine does not give any feedback on progress. No gas gauge, spinning indicator, nothing. How do we know if the write process is working?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to check progress. Run Apple&rsquo;s <code>Activity Monitor</code>, and look for <code>dd</code> on the list of processes, as shown in the Activity Monitor screenshot. The number of bytes written will increase slowly while <code>dd</code> burns the Ubuntu image onto the SD card. With the current version of Ubuntu, roughly 7.4GB will be written to the SD. At completion, <code>dd</code> will disappear from the Activity Monitor list and you&rsquo;ll see the following at the command line.</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo dd if=ubuntu-14.04-140611.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=64k
Password:
121280+0 records in
121280+0 records out
7948206080 bytes transferred in 3363.824531 secs (2362848 bytes/sec)</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you can see from the report, it took 3363.824531 seconds (just over 56 minutes) for <code>dd</code> to burn the Ubuntu image onto the SD card. That&rsquo;s a long time to wait with zero feedback. Activity Monitor will tell you what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h3>Confirm Partitions</h3>

<p>To confirm that the partitions have been created and that Ubuntu has been written to the SD card, use <code>diskutil list</code> again.</p>

<p>```bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        <em>500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS MacSSD                  499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        </em>15.9 GB    disk1
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 BOOT                    134.2 MB   disk1s1
   2:                      Linux                         7.3 GB     disk1s2</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>As expected, <code>/dev/disk0</code> remains unchanged. We want it that way because that&rsquo;s where our primary machine&rsquo;s operating system resides. <code>/dev/disk1</code> (your actual SD card designation may be different) is the target disk we&rsquo;re after. Two new partitions are on the SD card, a FAT32 partition named <code>BOOT</code> and a Linux partition.</p>

<p>Next we need to copy some supporting files to the new <code>BOOT</code> partition.</p>

<h3>Copying Additional Files to the SD Card</h3>

<p>Now that Ubuntu resides on the SD card, it&rsquo;s time to add the files that support HDMI video and the FPGAs. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<p>The additional files will need to be copied to <code>/BOOT</code> on the SD card. While it might make sense to reach the <code>BOOT</code> partition as <code>/dev/disk1</code>, you will actually reach it via <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<p>We target <code>/dev/disk1</code> when burning the Ubuntu image, but to copy the supporting files we target <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>. Both designations point to the same place, the SD card. Why the name switch?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why two different designations are used for the same SD card. I only know that it works. You can expect to see an update posted here if I find an explanation. Or if you have an answer, feel free to post in the comments below.</p>

<p>Before we copy over the files, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s on the <code>BOOT</code> partition on the SD card.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ cd /Volumes/BOOT/</p>

<p>/Volumes/BOOT$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxrwx@ 1 rth   staff   512 Jul  5 23:44 .
drwxrwxrwt@ 4 root  admin   136 Jul  5 23:44 ..
drwxrwxrwx  1 rth   staff   512 Jul  5 23:44 .Spotlight-V100
drwxrwxrwx@ 1 rth   staff   512 Jul  5 23:44 .Trashes
-rwxrwxrwx  1 rth   staff  4096 Jul  5 23:44 ._.Trashes
drwxrwxrwx  1 rth   staff   512 Jul  5 23:44 .fseventsd</p>

<p>/Volumes/BOOT$
```</p>

<h3>Gotcha #1: The FPGA Bitstream File</h3>

<p>First, change into the directory where you stored the additional Parallella files, and copy the FPGA bitstream file to <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>$ cp parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin /Volumes/BOOT/</p>

<p>$ cd /Volumes/BOOT/</p>

<p>$ mv parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin parallella.bit.bin</p>

<p>$</p>

<p><code>``
First gotcha: I made the mistake of simply copying the</code>parallella_e16_hdmi_gpiose_7010.bit.bin<code>file without renaming it to</code>parallella.bit.bin<code>. Parallella will only boot when it sees a file with this filename on the SD card's</code>BOOT<code>partition. The original file name will probably change as the software gets updated. With each change, we will need to make sure that the file is renamed</code>parallella.bit.bin` on the Parallella.</p>

<p>Obvious in hindsight, but it took me awhile to track that one down!</p>

<h3>Copy the Last Two Files</h3>

<p>Two files were decompressed from <code>kernel-hdmi-default.tgz</code>: <code>devicetree.dtb</code> and <code>uImage</code>. Change into the directory where the files were decompressed, and copy them to <code>/Volumes/BOOT</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
$ cp devicetree.dtb /Volumes/BOOT/</p>

<p>$ cp uImage /Volumes/BOOT/</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Here’s what the BOOT partition should look like when you’re done..</p>

<p>```bash
/Volumes/BOOT$ ls -al
total 12853
drwxrwxrwx@ 1 rth   staff     1024 Jul  6 12:14 .

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/eject_boot.png' width='' height='' alt='Eject the SD card.' title='Eject the SD card.'><span class='caption-text'>Eject the SD card.</span></span></p>

<h3>Eject the SD Card, Insert in Parallella</h3>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to eject the SD card from the Mac and insert it in the Parallella. Plug in the HDMI cable, keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet connection. Power up the Parallella, and welcome to the next <em>gotcha</em>.</p>

<h3>Gotcha #2: Powered USB Required</h3>

<p>Parallella booted to a beautiful GUI, but the system would not respond to the keyboard or mouse. After swapping a few keyboard/mouse combinations, I finally tried a powered USB hub. The powered hub worked.</p>

<p>Through trial and error I learned that the Parallella can handle a single keyboard plugged into the micro-USB port. However, if two devices are plugged in via USB, a powered hub is required. A passive USB hub will not work. A combination keyboard, one with both a keyboard and a trackpad, will also need a powered USB hub.</p>

<h3>Default Login Credentials</h3>

<p>Default login credentials for Parallella are&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>username = linaro</li>
<li>password = linaro</li>
</ul>


<h3>SSH, Vim, Git, etc.</h3>

<p>You can SSH into the Parallella from the network&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash
~$ ssh <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#108;&#105;&#x6e;&#x61;&#114;&#111;&#64;&#49;&#x39;&#50;&#46;&#49;&#54;&#56;&#x2e;&#x31;&#49;&#x2e;&#49;&#51;&#x33;">&#x6c;&#105;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x72;&#111;&#64;&#x31;&#x39;&#50;&#46;&#x31;&#x36;&#x38;&#x2e;&#49;&#x31;&#46;&#x31;&#51;&#51;</a>
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x6e;&#97;&#x72;&#111;&#x40;&#x31;&#57;&#x32;&#46;&#x31;&#x36;&#56;&#x2e;&#x31;&#49;&#46;&#x31;&#x33;&#51;">&#108;&#x69;&#x6e;&#97;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x31;&#57;&#x32;&#46;&#49;&#x36;&#x38;&#x2e;&#x31;&#49;&#46;&#49;&#51;&#x33;</a>&rsquo;s password:
Welcome to Linaro 14.04 (GNU/Linux 3.12.0-g0bc9c3a-dirty armv7l)</p>

linaro-nano:~&gt; git --version
git version 1.9.1

</code></p>

<h3>Scrot for Screenshots</h3>

<p>If you want to take a screenshot of the Parallella display, use <code>scrot</code>.  It comes with the Ubuntu installation. Type <code>scrot</code> at the command line and hit enter. Five seconds later, the entire screen will be captured and stored in a file called <code>[time stamp]_1920x1080_scrot.png</code> in the current directory.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After waiting a year for Parallella to arrive, I&rsquo;m excited to have the device up and running. Future posts will explore the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; behind parallel computing. Thanks Adapteva for helping to democratize supercomputing. Awesome times are ahead!</p>

<a href="http://sgi.com">Silicon Graphics International Corporation (SGI)</a> computers rendered the special effects for the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a> movie. Computer enthusiasts coveted SGI machines throughout the 1990s.</p>

<p>But success in the computer industry is fleeting. A few years after Jurassic Park, a convergence of tech advances (Moore&rsquo;s Law, x86 architecture, and Linux) made it possible for commodity PCs to perform as well as SGI&rsquo;s premium workstations. Wall Street traders and other power users abandoned workstations in favor of Linux-based PCs. High-end makers like SGI fell on hard times.</p>

<p>Today, SGI is fighting back. The company is blending x86, Linux, and (buzzword alert) big data to attack the high performance computing market. The vision was presented at this month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/chicagoacm/events/163287562/">Chicago ACM</a> meeting by Brian Freed, VP of Strategy for SGI.</p>

<h3>What is Big Data?</h3>

<p>Freed shared a definition of big data from <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/01/what-is-big-data.html">Edd Dumbill&rsquo;s O'Reilly Radar article</a>. Big data is characterized by volume (lots of it), variety (it&rsquo;s unstructured), and velocity (the data changes quickly).</p>

<p>In the words of the O'Reilly author&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Big data is data that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems. The data is too big, moves too fast, or doesn’t fit the strictures of your database architectures. To gain value from this data, you must choose an alternative way to process it.</p>

<p>~Edd Dumbill</p></blockquote>

<p>Definitions are fine, but it&rsquo;s more important to understand <em>why</em> a company might care about big data. Here are a few examples that Freed shared during the ACM meeting.</p>

<h3>Example: Fraud Detection with Big Data</h3>

<p>Consider one challenge faced by credit card companies. When a credit card is presented for an online purchase, how does the authorizing body know if the charge is legitimate? Can legitimacy be determined in a timely fashion, before an impatient buyer abandons a slow seller for a quicker seller?</p>

<p>Sellers who decide too quickly will suffer fraud. Sellers who decide too slowly will lose customers. The problem is amplified because millions of shoppers are clicking the &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; button simultaneously, and they all expect an answer <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>Traditional fraud detection systems could measure just a few potential fraud criteria within the allowed time window. SGI solves the problem with <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop clusters</a> running on SGI hardware. This big data design is able to examine each transaction deeper, and render a yes/no decision faster. Buyers are happier because they can complete a purchase faster. Companies are happier because fraud is reduced.</p>

<p>Big data helps credit card companies to make better authorization decisions in less time.</p>

<h3>Example: Auto Manufacturing</h3>

<p>Some problems, like credit authorization, require a quick response.  Other problems, like manufacturing, require the problem solver to crunch large volumes of data.</p>

<p>Consider an auto manufacturer. Every system in the modern automobile is controlled by software on silicon. Where software runs, data can be collected. The data piles up rapidly over time.</p>

<p>Manufacturers have discovered some unexpected benefits of collecting so much data. For example, they can identify trends like common failures among components, and use that data to improve future components. They can spot hidden trends, like geographic issues related to extreme cold or heat, and then design parts that are specially equipped for the target environment.</p>

<p>For these particular manufacturing examples, handling huge volumes of data is more important than delivering a quick answer. Insights that lead to quality improvements can be delivered in hours, and that&rsquo;s fast enough for the designers. Before big data, many design decisions were driven by instinct and experience alone. Big data helps auto companies to make more informed decisions.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls of Big Data</h3>

<p>One big pitfall is trying to use the big data <em>hammer</em> for every <em>nail</em> in sight, whether the solution fits the problem or not. It&rsquo;s the same hazard we face with any new technology. We run the risk of using a sledgehammer when a fly swatter would do.</p>

<p>A few ways to avoid the pitfalls: Start small. Have goals. And, like any good agile software developer, iterate. In Freed&rsquo;s words&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Successful implementation of big data is not an event. It is an iterative process where we continuously learn over time.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Anyone can build a fast CPU. The trick is to build a fast system.
&nbsp;<br/>
~ Seymour Cray</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chicago chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href="http://www.chicagoacm.org/">Chicago ACM</a>) hosted a lecture titled <em>Supercomputing and You</em> yesterday evening. The talk was delivered by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharankalwani">Sharan Kalwani</a> of <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>. Kalwani&rsquo;s background blends mechanical engineering and computer science with decades of high performance computing experience.</p>

<h3>10x => High Performance Computing</h3>

<p>Kalwani began his talk by drawing a distinction between <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing (HPC)</em>. Supercomputing is the buzzword that everyone knows, but the word implies that the designers are focused only on improving CPU performance. Such narrow focus could cause us to ignore important subsystems. For example, if engineers focus strictly on CPU performance, applications that are CPU-bound will quickly encounter I/O bottlenecks. High performance computing takes the entire system into account: CPU, I/O, cache, memory&hellip; anything that can influence performance.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This article will use the terms <em>supercomputing</em> and <em>high performance computing</em> interchangably because we are discussing the field in general. In an engineering document, the distinction would be more important.</p>

<p>By definition, supercomputers perform at least ten times faster than the current state-of-the art. The definition is a moving target. The processor in today&rsquo;s smartphone would have been considered a high performance computer a decade ago.</p>

<h3>The First Supercomputer</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cray.com/">Seymour Cray</a> is regarded as the father of the supercomputer. Cray cobbled together the first supercomputer using off-the-shelf components of the day and his unique ideas about computer architecture.</p>

<p>For example, Cray observed that the speed of an electrical signal was one bottleneck in computer performance. Electrical signals travel at the speed of light. Light can travel roughly one foot in one nanosecond.  Therefore, Cray decided that all internal cables in his new system would be less than a foot in length. No input would need to wait more than a nanosecond for a signal.</p>

<p>The 1972-era Cray supercomputer ran at a clock speed of 80MHz. It used a 64-bit word size. As a point of comparison, a 1972-era business mainframe ran at 4MHz with a 16-bit word size.</p>

<h3>Supercomputers&hellip; So What?</h3>

<p>Why do we need to spend time and money on high performance computers?  How does the general public benefit?</p>

<p>HPC enables us to solve problems that elude typical computers. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Auto safety testing</em>. Kalwani spent several years using HPC to run simulated crash tests for General Motors. A physical crash test, one in which the car is destroyed, costs $500k per car. The same test can be run in a simulator for $5k. Engineers still need to test a physical car at the end of the testing cycle, but the number of cars destroyed is drastically reduced. The business advantage of HPC-simulated tests is clear.</li>
<li><em>Nuclear testing</em>. It is very expensive (measured both in dollars and in human lives) to test a nuclear power plant. Fortunately, scientists know enough about nuclear behavior to create realistic simulations. Testing via simulation helps to manage costs and reduce accidents.</li>
<li><em>Weather forecasting</em>. The first supercomputers needed three days to predict the weather for <em>tomorrow</em>. What good is a 2-day-old weather forecast? A good forecast can save lives by telling people to evacute before a life-threatening natural disaster. Today&rsquo;s supercomputers can produce accurate weather forecasts while the reader still has time to take action.</li>
<li><em>Bioinformatics</em>. When scientists can reliably simulate drug behavior before live human testing, medical treatments can be improved and lives can be saved.</li>
<li><em>Energy exploration</em>. As long as people depend on fossil fuels, new sources need to be discovered in a timely and cost-effective way.  Supercomputers can process seismic data quickly and with sufficient granularity to tell prospectors where to drill.</li>
</ul>


<p>The bottom line: High performance computers deliver a return on investment that far outweighs their cost.</p>

<h3>Trickle Down Technology</h3>

<p>Many of the advances that we enjoy on today&rsquo;s laptops were invented by HPC architects. Kalwani shared one example: Cray invented the solid state disk (SSD) when mechanical disk drives proved to be a bottleneck. Can you imagine what an SSD must have cost in 1982 when it was invented? Today, SSDs are standard equipment on many laptops.</p>

<h3>Who Has the Fastest Supercomputer?</h3>

<p><a href="http://top500.org/">Top500.org</a> lists the fastest supercomputers on the planet, ordered by number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The race to be the fastest is highly competitive, so check the list for the latest champion.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the Top 500 list is missing a few names. Some governments or companies might not want to publicize their HPC skills.</p>

<h3>Speed vs. Power</h3>

<p>Supercomputers gulp electricity. Rule of thumb: One megawatt of electricity used over the course of one year costs $1 million. The fastest supercomputer in the world uses 17 megawatts of electricity, so its owners have an annual electric bill of $17 million dollars.</p>

<p><a href="http://green500.org">The Green 500</a> list recognizes the most energy efficient supercomputers in the world.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Paradigm</h3>

<p>Kalwani closed the historical section of his talk with a discussion of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">The Fourth Paradigm</a> of discovery. The concept comes from a collection of essays published by Microsoft Press. As of this writing, a free PDF of the book is available from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/">Microsoft Research</a>.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s introduction posits that there have been four paradigms of human scientific discovery:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Empirical</em>. Started a thousand years ago. Science was all about describing natural phenomena.</li>
<li><em>Theoretical</em>. Started a few hundred years ago. Scientific understanding is achieved via models and generalizations.</li>
<li><em>Computational</em>. Started a few decades ago. Scientists seek understanding by simulating complex phenomena using computer models.</li>
<li><em>Data Exploration (eScience)</em>. Starting now. Scientists now have the technology to capture and store huge quantities of data, inexpensively and indefinitely. Software will &ldquo;look&rdquo; for trends in the data using statistical models. The software will identify trends in the data, and point them out for further investigation.</li>
</ul>


<p>One example of the Fourth Paradigm in action: Recent discoveries of sub-atomic particles were initiated by eScience. Software running on high performance computers identified trends, and the scientists followed up with deeper investigation. Discoveries followed after that.</p>

<p>Businesses have led the way in extracting trends from mountains of data. This path offered limited results for scientists because computers were too slow to handle scientific data in a timely fashion. Partial differential equations eat many CPU cycles!</p>

<p>High performance computing opens up a new universe of data insight for scientists and engineers.</p>

<h3>The Future of HPC</h3>

<p>Kalwani ended the talk by looking into his crystal ball and telling us about the future of HPC. A few trends on the horizon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Power consumption issues will dominate discussions. High performance computers are terribly inefficient. Either we need to find a free, unlimited supply of energy (unlikely) or we must design supercomputers that gulp less power.</li>
<li>GPGPUs. General purpose graphics processing units are already used for non-graphics applications, like Bitcoin mining. As more applications are discovered for the devices, faster GPGPUs will follow.</li>
<li>ARM. Advanced Risc Machine processors use less power and their performance continues to increase. Could ARM hold the key to power reduction in high performance computing?</li>
<li>Rex Parallella. Fresh from last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing Conference</a>: <a href="http://www.rexcomputing.com/">Rex Computing</a> is using <a href="http://www.parallella.org/">Parallella</a> boards to build low-energy high performance computing clusters.</li>
<li>Quantum computing. Kalwani ran out of time as he was covering this item, but he shared enough to spark my interest. He explained quantum computing by using an analogy: Quantum computing is to digital computing as digital computing is to the abacus. The degree of advancement is that dramatic. <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a> is one company exploring this area.</li>
</ul>

But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.</p>

<h3>Inspiration in a Suitcase</h3>

<p>The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my <em>regular work</em> faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent time learning assembler with the HP 5036.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/hp-5036.png' width='' height='' alt='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab' title='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab'><span class='caption-text'>HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab</span></span></p>

<p>The entire 5036 fits in a suitcase&hellip; how cool is that! Here&rsquo;s how the 5036 works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing assembler-level code by hand on paper.</li>
<li>Grab the reference book for the microprocessor running on the
board, Intel 8080.</li>
<li>For each assembler-level command, find the corresponding 2-digit
hexidecimal operation code.</li>
<li>Key the op code into the 5036 by hand.</li>
<li>Run the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Working with the 5036 was addictive in a positive way. In a subsequent job, where I wrote assembler to drive hardware devices, I was ready.</p>

<h3>Portability Needed</h3>

<p>Fast forward a few decades. We now have the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella. Wonderful devices with one flaw in common: No portability. That&rsquo;s when I had a flashback to my days with the 5036.</p>

<p>I bought a $35 technician box from Home Depot and I ripped out the insides. Micro Center had 720p LCD monitors on sale for $90, so I bought one of those. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the extra bucks for a 1080p LCD because you never know how something like this might work out! Finally, I topped everything off with a $25 keyboard/trackpad combo from Amazon.  The result appears in the photo at the top of this article. Special thanks to Ericka [last name unknown] from Home Depot who gave me tons of ideas on how to securely fasten the monitor to the case.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why did I spend the time and money to assemble this kit? It&rsquo;s all about learning. Devs learn more when we interact with other devs &ndash; people who are learning some of the same things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with. And sometimes the things we need to learn are too new for books.</p>

<p>By carrying my Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella with me in a portable unit, I can share my experiences with other devs and learn more in the process. Everybody wins when that happens.</p>

<h3>Thanks SCNA!</h3>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA)</a> gave me the opportunity to present this story as a lightning talk at the conference. Slides are here:</p>

<p>Thank you SCNA! As I shared with the other devs at SCNA, I will gladly post my mistakes and <em>gotchas</em> here for people who want to build a unit like this. Let&rsquo;s build!</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/07/19/petascale-tools-workshop-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.paradyn.org/CSCADS2013/index.html">Petascale Tools Workshop</a> is for computer scientists who create tools that enable apps to run efficiently on the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputers. Supercomputer performance is measured in petaflops: 10<sup><sup>15</sup></sup> floating point operations per second. That&rsquo;s blazing speed, thousands of times faster than the fastest MacBook Pro.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://WisdomGroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> was invited to attend the workshop because we have a client client, <a href="http://www.wisdomgroup.com/case-studies/texas-am-university/">Texas A &amp; M University</a>, operating in the high performance computing (HPC) space. As the only non-PhD in the room, I was given a chance to exercise Pat Metheny&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2013/07/17/pat-metheny-be-the-worst/">be-the-worst</a> philosophy in the extreme. The result: I learned things that will help WisdomGroup to deliver better solutions for our clients, especially the TAMU team.</p>

<h3>One Megawatt = $1,000,000.00</h3>

<p>As with other disciplines of engineering, supercomputer design is all about managing trade-offs. If you increase the clock speed, how will that affect your electrical bill? If you increase the size of the cache, how much more will you spend on hardware?</p>

<p>Every Petascale Workshop presenter highlighted the toughest constraint: The cost of electrical power. High performance computers gulp electricity. The wattage numbers were all very abstract to me until one presenter layed out a direct one-to-one correspondence between electricity and money. <em>One megawatt of power used over the course of a year costs one million dollars.</em></p>

<p>Express a constraint in terms of money, and the abstractions melt away.</p>

<p>The debate between the scientists was vigorous yet respectful. After hearing the 1-to-1 rule of thumb, one audience member remarked, &ldquo;I know how to genererate a megawatt for only $865,000.&rdquo; He then outlined his solution, a combination of coal, fossil fuels, and natural gas that would achieve the reduction. The more important point: Electricity is expensive.</p>

<h3>Re-Framing the Power Problem</h3>

<p>There is another way to look at the power problem. Consider it from the perspective of performance, not power. Here&rsquo;s how one presenter put it: No matter where we build a supercomputer, we will only have a limited amount of power. Let&rsquo;s look at the maximum available power as a constraint and go from there.</p>

<p>Rubyists are familiar with the saying &#34;<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php">constraints are liberating</a>&#34;, popularized by 37signals. Since power limitations are real constraints, our next step is to figure out how to extract the best results allowed within the constraints.</p>

<h3>Top Five</h3>

<p>Supercomputer scientists are as competitive as olympic athletes. As of June 2013, the five fastest machines in the world are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br/>
Scientists determine Rmax by running the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a> benchmark. <a href="http://top500.org">Top500.org</a> has more information about the fastest
machines.</p>

<h3>Digging Deeper</h3>

<p>Some of the biggest performance gains can be realized through more efficient software. Most supercomputers run some distribution of Linux. Some teams of researchers focus on ways to optimize the Linux kernel for supercomputing.</p>

<p>Optimization is not a one-size-fits all process. The scientists need to consder the type of applications being run, percentage of time spent on I/O, efficiency of algorithms, and so on. Each potential optimization choice is like a node on an ever expanding tree. The choices are endless, and the seasoned expert will know where to focus for the best results.</p>

<p>In the Ruby world, we might use tools like <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> or <a href="http://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> to identify hot spots in our code, places where re-factoring can reduce CPU utilization or improve I/O. HPC tools tend to be highly customizable because the users are intimately familar with their own hardware. During a lunch conversation, one team of scientists shared how they suspected a defect in hardware counters used to measure the behavior of a supercomputer under study. The instincts of the scientists proved correct, and the errant counters were replaced.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When smart people challenge each other to grow, great things happen. The scientists at the Petascale Tools Workshop were clearly helping each other to grow. The next few years in supercomputing will be exciting!</p>
