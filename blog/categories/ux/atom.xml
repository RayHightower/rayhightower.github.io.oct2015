<blockquote><p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a faster horse.</p>

<p>~Henry Ford</p></blockquote>

<p>The above Henry Ford quote is often cited in presentations about innovation. The point of the quote: An inventor who listens to customers too closely, without observing customer behavior, will reap tiny improvements at best. Ford ignored the request for &ldquo;a faster horse&rdquo;, and that is how the Ford Motor Company became a leader in the early auto industry.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one way to interpret Ford&rsquo;s quote. Last night, I was introduced to another view.</p>

<h3>Parse the Quote Differently, Don&rsquo;t Ignore it</h3>

<p>Last night&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ixdachicago.org">IxDA Chicago</a> meeting featured a presentation by <a href="http://chris-holmes.com">Chris Holmes</a>, who shared a different view of the Ford quote. If we focus on improving the speed of horses (perhaps through nutrition or better horse shoes) very little improvement can be achived.</p>

<p>But something interesting happens when we parse the quote differently. The adjective <em>faster</em> reveals the customer&rsquo;s true need. The noun <em>horse</em> is the customer&rsquo;s &ldquo;solution&rdquo; based on what they currently know about the world. For the innovator, <em>faster</em> stands out. Focusing on <em>faster</em> leads to innovation.</p>

<h3>Focus on Faster</h3>

<p><em>Faster</em> tells us that we can stretch beyond our current thinking and consider other modes of transportation. Focusing on <em>faster</em> led to the beginning of the automobile industry.</p>

<p>Customers are communicating their desires all the time. We need to listen carefully and parse well. Thanks IxDA Chicago and Chris Holmes for the lesson.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> is a small device that lets users control their computers with simple hand gestures. The Leap Motion controller senses individual hand and finger movements. This is not a touch interface, because your hands never touch anything.</p>

<h4>Why Leap Motion?</h4>

<p>Computers became easier to use when the mouse grew popular in the 1980s. Touchscreens offer another solution for the interaction riddle. The Leap Motion controller looks like another solution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still very early for Leap Motion. New applications will be born through this device. Stay tuned!</p>
