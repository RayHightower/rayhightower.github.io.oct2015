<p>Part one of this series shows <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black</a>. We used a MacBook Pro to burn an Ubuntu disk image onto an SD card, and then we booted a BeagleBone Black from the image we created.</p>

<p>This post, part two, covers the installation of the Ubuntu GUI, Ruby, and Rails. All of the commands in this article are run on the BeagleBone Black.</p>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> bonus: Rails requires a JavaScript runtime, and Node.js offered the quickest way to fulfill this requirement. Details appear within.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Partition Size</h3>

<p>At the end of <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1/">part one</a>, we successfully booted the Bone with the Ubuntu command line interface. Now it&rsquo;s time to add the GUI. Two things to know about the Ubuntu GUI installation&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The partition we created on the SD card (in part one) is too small to hold the Ubuntu GUI. Solution: The SD card has some extra room, and we can re-size the partition.</li>
<li>We can install the Ubuntu GUI with a single line command. But it takes an hour for the Bone to download, compile, and install all of the GUI libraries.</li>
</ul>


<p>If we try to install the GUI with insufficient space, the installation will fail midway and we will have wasted half an hour. So it&rsquo;s best to re-size first.</p>

<h3>Doing Our Own Re-Sizing?</h3>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the partition have the right size when we originally downloaded the image file? Good question.</p>

<p>My guess: The image file was designed to be as small as possible in order to minimize download time. That makes sense. I plan to test this theory by creating a new image with a larger partition size and a pre-installed GUI. If the test is successful, results will be posted on this blog. If the mission fails, then the secretary will disavow any knowledge&hellip;</p>

<h3>How to Re-Size the Partition</h3>

<p><code>df</code> is the Unix &lsquo;disk free&rsquo; command. It shows used/available disk space.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ df</p>

<p>Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs           3778576 2722944    885776  76% /
/dev/root        3778576 2722944    885776  76% /
devtmpfs          253580       4    253576   1% /dev

/dev/mmcblk1p2   1748200    2664   1655068   1% /media/rootfs</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p><code>ll</code> is one of the useful aliases built into Ubuntu&rsquo;s <code>.bashrc</code> file. We
can use it to examine the partitions on the SD card.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ ll /dev/mmcblk*</p>

<p>brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  0 Jan  5 15:37 /dev/mmcblk0
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  1 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk0p1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  2 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk0p2
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  8 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 16 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot0
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 24 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179,  9 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1p1
brw-rw&mdash;&mdash; 1 root disk 179, 10 Jan  1  2000 /dev/mmcblk1p2</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p><code>fdisk</code> will resize the partition we&rsquo;re after. <code>root</code> priviledges are required to modify the partition table, so we&rsquo;ll use <code>sudo</code>. The standard warnings about sudo apply.</p>

<p>A few useful <code>fdisk</code> commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>p</code> prints the partition table.</li>
<li><code>d</code> deletes a partition.</li>
<li><code>n</code> creates a new partition.</li>
<li><code>w</code> write new information to the partition table.</li>
<li><code>q</code> quits fdisk.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the plan: In order to increase the size of <code>/dev/mmcblk0p2</code>, we will delete it, and then re-create it with a larger size. Note the use of the <code>d</code> and <code>n</code> commands in the following sequence. When <code>fdisk</code> asks us for the new partition number, type, first sector, and last sector, we will choose the defaults. Choosing the defaults will use all of the available space on the SD card.</p>

<p>Your numbers will vary depending on the size and configuration of your SD card, but the general procedure will be the same.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

The partition table has been altered!</p>

<p>Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.</p>

the next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)
Syncing disks.</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p>The warning/error message at the end just means that we need reboot the Bone before the partition table takes effect.</p>

<p>Reboot the BeagleBone Black, holding down the boot switch (closest to
the USB port) to ensure that we boot to the system on the SD card
instead of the eMMC.</p>

<p>After the Bone reboots, run <code>resize2fs</code> to expand the partition created above.</p>

<p>```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
[sudo] password for ubuntu:
resize2fs 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
Filesystem at /dev/mmcblk0p2 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 1
The filesystem on /dev/mmcblk0p2 is now 951424 blocks long.</p>

<p>ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$
```</p>

<p>And now we have enough room to install the Ubuntu GUI.</p>

<h3>Installing the Ubuntu GUI</h3>

<p>After the partition on the SD card has been resized, this command will intall the GUI. The command is short, but the process takes about an hour:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
</code>
When installation and compilation are complete, Ubuntu will return to the command prompt. Here&rsquo;s how to reboot:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo reboot
</code></p>

<p>Several minutes later, the Ubuntu 12 GUI will appear. Congratulations!  Login using the default credentials (login: ubuntu, pw: ubuntu) to get to the Ubuntu desktop.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Running RVM</h3>

<p>I prefer to use the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) for bouncing between Ruby versions. RVM misbehaved, initially. Then I learned something special about RVM&rsquo;s interaction with Ubuntu. From the RVM support pages…</p>

<blockquote><p>For RVM to work properly, you have to set the &lsquo;Run command as login shell&rsquo; checkbox on the Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal&rsquo;s Settings page.</p></blockquote>

<p>This image shows the checkbox mentioned in the quote. It&rsquo;s inside of the lower red rectangle.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/rvm-ubuntu-run-command_as_login-shell.jpg' width='' height='' alt='RVM: Run command as login shell.' title='RVM: Run command as login shell.'><span class='caption-text'>RVM: Run command as login shell.</span></span></p>

<p>Details are in the RVM support article <a href="http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal">Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Ruby Installation</h3>

<p>Ruby installation initially failed (speculation) because the Bone went into power save mode during the installation process. Ruby installed successfully on the second try when I kept the machine awake by moving the mouse. This <em>power save hypothesis</em> has not been thoroughly tested.</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Rails Installation</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/nodejs-white.png' width='' height='' alt='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.' title='Node.js on BeagleBone Black.'><span class='caption-text'>Node.js on BeagleBone Black.</span></span>
Rails needs a JavaScript runtime in order to function. Here are two ways to meet this requirement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Node.js, or</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/therubyracer">therubyracer</a> gem.</li>
</ul>


<p>Installing <code>therubyracer</code> did not work for me. But Node.js installed quickly, like so:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
</code></p>

<p>Now that we have a JavaScript runtime, Rails runs successfully.</p>

<p>Side note: If you want to see what a Node.js-equipped Bone can do, check
out <a href="http://openrov.com">OpenROV</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Bottom line: Ruby, Rails, and Ubuntu can run successfully on BeagleBone Black, with Node.js as a bonus.</p>

<p>The BeagleBone Black is a cool option for running Ubuntu. Yes, it runs slower than a typical laptop. But it runs, and at $45 each we can build a cluster of Bones if we&rsquo;re concerned about performance!</p>

<p>What an amazing bundle of technology.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/01/02/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails.jpg' width='' height='' alt='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.' title='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.'><span class='caption-text'>BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.</span></span></p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, and Rails. Why Ubuntu? The Bone comes <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">pre-installed with Ångström</a>, and it boots as soon as you unbox it. Why not stick with Ångström?</p>

<p>My opinion: The factory standard is fine, but it&rsquo;s always good to have options. Here&rsquo;s why I decided to try Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu documentation is plentiful. Books, blogs, and videos are readily available.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu community is huge. When a dev runs into an Ubuntu-related snag, it&rsquo;s likely that another dev has encountered a similar problem, and they can collaborate on a solution.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the distro that I&rsquo;m most familiar with. <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> uses Ubuntu for multiple projects. With a common operating system, knowledge gained in one environment is immediately useful in another.</li>
<li>Prepping for <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a>, the 64-core single-board computer that will cost about two hundred bucks. The Parallella is currently in short supply. When it becomes available, it will run Ubuntu. Experience with other single-board computers, especially those running Ubuntu, will prove useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>This article will show how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black. <em>Gotchas</em> will be pointed out along the way. Where possible, I will explain the reasons behind my decisions so that you can make different choices if you like.</p>

<h3>Sudo Disclaimer: You Could Destroy Everything</h3>

<p>Procedures described here will ask you to use the <code>sudo</code> command. <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">Sudo endows users with great power</a>. You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using <code>sudo</code> incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date by the time you read this. Please be careful, and double-check these steps through your own sources.</p>

<h3>First Gotcha: Ubuntu 13 on the Bone</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 12 runs well on the BeagleBone Black, but Ubuntu 13 does not. My Ubuntu 13 installation appeared to be successful, but the Ubuntu 13 GUI hung up immediately after login. The Ubuntu 13 command line interface worked fine.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google reveals that others encountered similar roadblocks with version 13. One successful Bone/13 installation was used via SSH, not interactively via keyboard and GUI. Hopefully this will change with future updates. Or, since we&rsquo;re dealing in the open source world, maybe I can pitch in and help.</p>

<p>Due to the issues encountered with version 13, everything in this article will focus on Ubuntu 12.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Installing Ubuntu 12</h3>

<p>In addition to the BeagleBone Black, the following items should be gathered before installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro SD card of at least 8GB. It&rsquo;s possible to perform the installation with a 4GB card, but that won&rsquo;t leave much room for Ubuntu applications.</li>
<li>SD card reader/writer. Recent versions of Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro come with an SD reader/writer built in.</li>
<li>SD to Micro-SD card adapter. The Bone is designed for micro SD, and the MacBook Pro is designed for full-sized SD. Some micro SD packages come with the adapter.</li>
<li>A monitor that accepts HDMI input.</li>
<li>USB keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter. The Bone uses micro HDMI for video output, but your monitor probably uses full-sized HDMI.</li>
<li>External 5V power adapter for the Bone. Personally, I trust the standard 5v power input more than I trust the power provided via USB. One never knows if USB can provide sufficient (and stable) amperage for a circuit board. Power fluctuations can lead to strange behavior, including video flickering.</li>
<li>Ethernet cable with RJ-45 ends.</li>
<li>A fast internet connection.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Homebrew Required</h3>

<p>Homebrew is the easiest way to install &lsquo;nix utilities on Mac OS X. We need Homebrew in order to install some of the utilities needed to burn the SD card. The one-line Homebrew installation command is given on the  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew site</a>.</p>

<p>Each time we use Homebrew, we run <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> to make sure the packages are up-to-date.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run</code>brew update`.</p>

<p>$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from a2e44659 to 4c7bc9ec.</p>

<p>$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```</p>

<h3>The xz Extraction Utility</h3>

<p>Disk image files are downloaded in a compressed format. We need the <code>xz</code> utility in order to extract the files into something usable. If you already have Homebrew installed, this command will install <code>xz</code> for you.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ brew install xz
</code></p>

<h3>Test the BeagleBone Black First</h3>

<p>Power up your BeagleBone Black and make sure it runs with the built-in Ångström Linux installation. One great thing about the Bone is that it will <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">boot to the Ångström GUI</a> straight out of the box, with no prior configuration.</p>

<p>If the GUI boots, then you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>If the GUI doesn&rsquo;t boot, it may have been damaged in a prior experiement. Embarassing note: I started looking for a way to install Ubuntu on the Bone because I broke my Ångström installation. What can I say&hellip; I learn more from destructive experiments. Faced with a non-booting Bone, I had two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-build Ångström.</li>
<li>Try something different, like Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Option two worked well!</p>

<h3>Prep the SD Card</h3>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility is a convenient tool for wiping the SD card.  Standard warnings about any disk utility apply. Double-check everything, and make sure you&rsquo;re wiping the right volume, or you could lose all of your data.</p>

<p>Next, download the Ubuntu 12.04 image from <a href="http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/#precise">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the image using the <code>xz</code> utility.
<code>bash
$ xz ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz
</code></p>

<p>The extracted image will have a <code>.img</code> file extension. We will use the <code>dd</code> utility to burn the disk image to the SD card. But first, we need to determine the designation of the SD card.</p>

<h3>Find the SD Card Designation</h3>

<p>In order to burn the SD card, we need to make sure we target it correctly. Here&rsquo;s how to figure out which device to target.</p>

<p><code>$ diskutil list</code> will show all of the partitions mounted on the system.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk1
</code>
I happen to know that my SD Card is 8.0 GB in capacity, and my system also has a 500 GB SSD. The goal is to burn the SD card while leaving the 500 GB SSD (home of the Mac OS X operating system and all of my data) intact. From the <code>$ diskutil list</code> report, I can see that the SD card&rsquo;s designation <em>in my system</em> is <code>/dev/disk1</code>.</p>

<p>Note the italicized words <em>in my system</em>. Your system is probably different, especially if you have a DVD drive or a second hard drive. I have neither of those. The SD card&rsquo;s designation will be different in each system where it is mounted depending on the number and location of the drives that are already there.</p>

<p>Now that we know the SD card&rsquo;s designation, we can unmount it. We unmount the drive (but leave the card inserted in the reader) so that it can be written with the Ubuntu disk image.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful
</code></p>

<p>Looks like the SD card was unmounted successfully. Now we can write the
Ubuntu image with the <code>dd</code> utility.</p>

<h3>Writing the Ubuntu Image</h3>

<p>The following command will write the decompressed Ubuntu image to the SD
card.</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo dd bs=1m if=ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img of=/dev/disk1</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note that it may take up to an hour for the image to be written.</p>

<p>One drawback of using the command line is that there is no gauge to tell you how much progress the utility is making. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a way to measure progress at <a href="http://elinux.org">eLinux.org</a>. While the command line utility is running, and while that window has focus, type <code>control-T</code>. A few seconds later, the terminal window will show a brief activity report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a report from the first time I struck <code>control-T</code> &hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
load: 2.03  cmd: dd 75608 uninterruptible 0.00u 0.54s
40+0 records in

<h3>Booting with the New SD Card</h3>

<p>The terminal will return to the command prompt after the Ubuntu image has been written to the SD card. Now it&rsquo;s time to boot with the new image.</p>

<ol>
<li>Eject the SD card from the Mac.</li>
<li>Remove power from the BeagleBone Black, and insert the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Note the location of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; button on the Bone. It&rsquo;s the micro switch closest to the USB port. We will need to hold this switch down while powering up the Bone.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few notes about item #3. It takes some juggling to hold down a micro switch while plugging in power to the board. I found it easier to plug the power adapter into a powered-off surge suppressor, hold down the microswitch, and then power-on the surge suppressor with my elbow.  Sounds ridiculous, but it worked.</p>

<p>About sixty seconds after boot, the Linux penguin appeared in the upper left corner of the Bone display. And then the login prompt appeared.</p>

<p>Another note about the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; switch: It looks like the Bone will boot into the SD&rsquo;s operating system (instead of the eMMC flash OS where Angstrom resides) without the micro switch if the switch was used in the previous boot. I haven&rsquo;t rebooted enough times to test this thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Default Credentials for Ubuntu on BeagleBone Black</h3>

<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default BeagleBone Black login credentials are shown here because I always end up hunting for these when I need them. It&rsquo;s much easier to have information at one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<p><code>bash
login: ubuntu
pw: ubuntu
</code></p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/12/06/homebrew-ruby-and-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I encountered some interesting behavior between <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and Ruby this afternoon. I can describe what happened, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why. Perhaps another member of the dev community can shed some light.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Git 1.8.5</h3>

<p>Earlier today I learned that Git 1.8.5 was available. So I decided to upgrade. Since I use Homebrew for package management, it was time for <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> as well.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Error: Homebrew doesn't know what compiler versions ship with your version
of Xcode (5.0.2). Please</code>brew update<code>and if that doesn't help, file
an issue with the output of</code>brew &mdash;config`:
  <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues</a></p>

<p>Thanks!
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$
```</p>

<p><code>$ brew doctor</code> has spoken. Time to update Homebrew.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Homebrew First. Git Later.</h3>

<p>Updating Homebrew is as simple as <code>$ brew update</code>, right?</p>

<p><code>``bash
~$ brew update
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/ant over mxcl/master/ant
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/cvs over mxcl/master/cvs
Error: undefined method</code>to_sym' for nil:NilClass
Please report this bug:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting
</code></pre>

<p>/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:123:in <code>report'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:121:in</code>each_line'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:121:in <code>report'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:35:in</code>update'
/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:95:in `send'
/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:95</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$
<code>``
</code>$ brew update` choked. Further, Homebrew said that I should report a bug. But something smelled fishy. I decided to try running Homebrew under Ruby 2.0.0 instead of Ruby 1.9.3, the default on my system. Running <a href="/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a> makes bouncing between Ruby versions a snap.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm use 2.0.0</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>That did the trick. <code>$ brew update</code> worked fine, and <code>$ brew doctor</code>
confirmed it.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from 69a83176 to 691c72bf.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>~$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Back to Git</h3>

<p>Now that the yak is well-shaved, we&rsquo;re ready to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ brew upgrade git
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result:
git 1.8.5.1

<h6>################################################################## 100.0%</h6>

<p>==> Pouring git-1.8.5.1.mountain_lion.bottle.tar.gz

<p>zsh completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> Summary
  /usr/local/Cellar/git/1.8.5.1: 1333 files, 30M
```</p>

<p>Mission accomplished. Git has been upgraded to 1.8.5.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ git &mdash;version
git version 1.8.5.1</p>

<p>~$
```</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m posting this article as a note to my future self. Error messages sometimes lie. They don&rsquo;t mean to lie, but an error messsage can only give you its best guess based on what it <em>thinks</em> is happening on your system. It&rsquo;s up to the developer to sniff out the rest of the clues.</p>

<p>After decades in this industry, I&rsquo;m still learning this lesson :&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/11/25/awesome-print-motion-for-rubymotion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re building a version of Atari&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2013/02/26/atari-pong-rubymotion-objective-c/">Pong in RubyMotion</a>. We&rsquo;re debugging an issue with the paddles; they don&rsquo;t line up the way we want them to. Time to examine the playing field via the RubyMotion console.</p>

<p><code>bash
pong-rm $ rake
</code></p>

<p>Mouse over the playing field and <code>Command-click</code> to grab the entire playing field object in the RubyMotion console. Confirm that you grabbed the object by typing <code>self</code> at the console prompt.</p>

<p>```ruby
(UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], &hellip;)> self</p>

<p>=> UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], [480.0, 320.0]]), child of UIView(#c876920)
```</p>

<p>And then, to see what objects are on the playing field, use
<code>self.subviews</code> to show the subviews array of the current object.</p>

<p><code>ruby
(UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], ...)&gt; self.subviews
=&gt; [UIView(#9d82430, [[357.0, 175.0], [50.0, 50.0]]), child of
UIView(#9d820c0), PaddleView(#9d82580, [[410.0, 190.0], [20.0, 100.0]]),
child of UIView(#9d820c0), PaddleView(#9d82970, [[10.0, 190.0], [20.0,
100.0]]), child of UIView(#9d820c0), ScoreLabel(#9d82a80, [[110.0, 9.0],
[20.0, 42.0]], text: "1"), child of UIView(#9d820c0),
ScoreLabel(#9d83c90, [[350.0, 9.0], [20.0, 42.0]], text: "0"), child of
UIView(#9d820c0)]
(UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], ...)&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This blob of text is difficult for the human brain to parse. Now, let&rsquo;s try it with the <code>awesome_print_motion</code> gem.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>```ruby
(UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], &hellip;)> ap(self.subviews)
[</p>

<pre><code>[0] UIView(#9d82430, [[308.0, 118.0], [50.0, 50.0]]), child of UIView(#9d820c0),
[1] PaddleView(#9d82580, [[410.0, 190.0], [20.0, 100.0]]), child of UIView(#9d820c0),
[2] PaddleView(#9d82970, [[10.0, 190.0], [20.0, 100.0]]), child of UIView(#9d820c0),
[3] ScoreLabel(#9d82a80, [[110.0, 9.0], [39.0, 42.0]], text: "61"), child of UIView(#9d820c0),
[4] ScoreLabel(#9d83c90, [[350.0, 9.0], [20.0, 42.0]], text: "0"), child of UIView(#9d820c0)
</code></pre>

<p>]
=> nil
(UIView(#9d820c0, [[0.0, 0.0], &hellip;)></p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Much easier to read. The structure of the <code>subviews</code> array is clear. Each element of the array has an easy-to-read index. Debugging time is reduced.</p>

<h3>How to Install awesome_print_motion</h3>

<p>RubyMotion uses bundler. So we start by refering to <code>awesome_print_motion</code> in our gemfile.</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem 'awesome_print_motion'
</code></p>

<p>In the app&rsquo;s <code>Rakefile</code>, there are two possible ways to proceed. The preferred way is to use the following lines to tell the app to require every gem mentioned in Bundler&rsquo;s Gemfile:</p>

<p><code>ruby
begin
  require 'bundler'
  Bundler.require
rescue LoadError
end
</code></p>

<p>The older way is to manually add a <code>require</code> statement to the Rakefile.</p>

<p><code>ruby
require 'ap'
</code>
Personally, I prefer the newer way because it automatically
requires all of the gems mentioned in the <code>Gemfile</code>. The odds of a
typo-induced error are reduced.</p>

<h3>How to Use awesome_print_motion</h3>

<p>To use the new gem, start the app and explore away. Any time you want to
run output through the <code>awesome_print_motion</code> gem, send the code as a
parameter to the <code>ap</code> method like so&hellip;</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>ap(self.subviews)
```
&hellip; and the output will be easier to read.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
