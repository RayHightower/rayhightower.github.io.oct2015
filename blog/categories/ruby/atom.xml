<a href="http://madisonruby.com">Madison Ruby</a> 2013 was held this weekend. The conference attracts smart, intellectually curious people who are thirsty to learn more.</p>

<p>By the way, Madison Ruby was a lot of fun, too!</p>

<h3>Speakers: Impressive and Accessible</h3>

<p>First, lets cover the obvious high points so we can focus on those things that make Madison Ruby unique. Organizers <a href="https://twitter.com/jremsikjr">Jim</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/JenRemsik">Jen Remsik</a> have solidified their reputation for choosing engaging, well-prepared speakers. The Remsik network of speakers includes accomplished developers from around the world. Many are published authors. Some, like <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/">Danielle Lee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/marteeeen">Martin Atkins</a>, excel in fields outside of software development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What the presenters have in common: All are high achievers. All are inspiring. All take time to stick around after their time on stage to interact with attendees. That kind of interaction makes the Madison Ruby community work.</p>

<h3>Community in Madison</h3>

<p>Madison Ruby is unique in the way it brings the local community into the event. Local business and community leaders speak at the conference. The local leaders are enthusiastic about Madison and they engage attendees. One year, a farmer shared her experience growing up in a cheese-producing family business. This year, a biomedical engineering graduate of the University of Wisconsin encouraged the audience to build our creative muscles by having fun. She drove the point home with a hula-hoop demonstration, followed with a <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/classes/german-wheel/">German Wheel</a> performance by a colleague.</p>

<p>People from other worlds speaking at a software conference&hellip; it works.</p>

<h3>Meal Time</h3>

<p>Lunch was served by the entire Madison restaurant community. Gift certificates were supplied by Engine Yard, and the certificates were redeemable for meals at local restaurants.  What a wonderful way to put serendipity to work! Attendees who just met formed clusters of lunch parties on a whim. The conversations were rich.</p>

<h3>After-Hours Gatherings</h3>

<p>Thursday night&rsquo;s gathering, <a href="http://hypeharvest.com/">Hype Harvest</a>, had elements of a party but it was so much more. Hype Harvest was held on the roof of the Madison Museum of Modern Art, and it served multiple purposes. First, to raise funds for Nairobi Dev School, founded by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/tech/teenager-hacker-school-africa-google">Martha Chumo</a>, a 19-year-old software developer in Nairobi, Kenya. Second, to give everyone a taste of the presenters to come. Third, to let the attendees gather, renew old friendships, and begin new ones.</p>

<p>Friday night&rsquo;s party was held at <a href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>. An outdoor concert ran concurrently in the middle of the street next to the office. Bendyworks guests had the best seats around because the second floor office sits right above the musical stage.</p>

<h3>Madison Ruby and My Brother</h3>

<p>As an organizer of WindyCityRails, my relationship with Madison Ruby reminds me of my relationship with my brother, <a href="http://motoringventures.com">Edward Hightower</a>, while we were growing up. Edward and I are one year apart, and we competed aggressively in every way: On the swim team, in the <a href="http://troop534.org">Boy Scouts</a>, in academics&hellip; you name it. Through the competition, we learned to love and respect each other. My brother Edward is one of my closest friends. That doesn&rsquo;t always happen with family!</p>

<p>Madison Ruby competes with WindyCityRails. At the same time, I enjoy the trip to Madison because I get so much from the experience. Congratulations to the Madison Ruby organizer team for running a great event three years in a row. I plan to return next year.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/07/15/rvm-saves-the-day-for-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is a lean blogging engine that happens to power <a href="http://rayhightower.com">RayHightower.com</a>. Earlier today, after a quick update to the blog, I encountered the following:</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ rake generate
/Users/rth/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@global/gems/bundler-1.2.4/lib/bundler/rubygems_integration.rb:187:in</code>stub_source_index170': uninitialized constant Gem::SourceIndex (NameError)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Not good. What happened?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>From the error message, it appeared that my current version of Bundler was incompatible with Octopress. Googling for the error message (a favorite trick) was unhelpful. Had to try a different line of attack.</p>

<h3>The Solution: Roll Back</h3>

<p>Fortunately, I use <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a>. Currently installed versions of Ruby:</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   jruby-1.7.3 [ x86_64 ]
   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p448 [ x86_64 ]
=* ruby-2.0.0-p247 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Since <code>$ rake deploy</code> last worked with Ruby 1.9.2 on my machine, I decided to roll back to that point.</p>

<p>```bash
$ rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p290</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next, I built another <code>octopress</code> gemset to work with this version of Ruby, pointed to the gemset, and used Bundler to add the necessary gems.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm gemset create octopress
$ rvm gemset use octopress
$ bundle install
</code></p>

<p>And now <code>$ rake generate</code> works as required.</p>

<p>```bash
$ rake generate</p>

<h2>Generating Site with Jekyll</h2>

<p>identical source/stylesheets/screen.css
Configuration from /Users/rth/Code/Ruby/apps/rayhightower/_config.yml
Building site: source &ndash;> public
Successfully generated site: source &ndash;> public
```</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<h3>RVM Saves the Day</h3>

<p>Once again, RVM lets me recover quickly by shifting to an earlier version of Ruby. What&rsquo;s the root cause of the problem? I don&rsquo;t know at this point. But for now, the blog is up &amp; running!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-22T22:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack.jpg" width="372" height="600" title="BeagleBone Black" alt="BeagleBone Black" align="right">
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a>, like the <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, is a small, inexpensive computer that runs Linux. It&rsquo;s smaller than a deck of cards and you can buy one for about forty-five dollars ($45.00). The device is made by <a href="http://circuitco.com">CircuitCo</a> in Richardson, TX, USA.</p>

<h3>It Just Works</h3>

<p>BeagleBone Black runs Linux right out of the box. Steps required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in the micro-HDMI cable for the monitor. See the &ldquo;Gotchas&rdquo;
section about micro-HDMI below.</li>
<li>Plug in the keyboard &amp; mouse via the USB port. You might need a USB hub because the board only has one USB port.</li>
<li>Add power via the mini-USB port or the 5v power connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a few minutes of boot time, we have a fully-functioning Linux computer with a GUI, Firefox browser, and other tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The BeagleBone Black has 2GB of flash storage on the board, and part
of that is used for Linux. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot after just a few minutes of ownership.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-WindyCityRails.png" width="600" height="338" title="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" alt="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" align="center"></center>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-USB.png" width="250" height="200" title="BeagleBone Black USB" alt="BeagleBone Black USB" align="right">
All of the paper documentation for the BeagleBone Black fits on a slip of paper roughly the size of two business cards. The meat of the documentation resides on the device itself. To reach the electronic documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the BeagleBone Black into a USB port on your laptop.</li>
<li>The board will appear as a USB storage device. One of the files at the
root of the storage device, <code>START.htm</code>, contains the documentation. It
can be viewed in a web browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The documentation recommends against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">MSIE</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/micro-HDMI-home-depot.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Micro HDMI Home Depot" alt="Micro HDMI Home Depot" align="right">
The manufacturer included a mini-USB cable with the device, so you can power it up right after you rip open the package. Gotcha: You need a micro-HDMI cable (or adapter) if you want to attach a monitor. I would have preferred a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapater in the box instead of the mini-USB cable. That&rsquo;s a little nit-picky on my part since micro-HDMI cables are easy to find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to Home Depot: Their store-brand cables let you test the cable end without opening the package, right in the store. Excellent package design by Home Depot.</p>

<p>My second &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; is more important: The <code>curl</code> command did not behave as flawlessly as it did with the Raspberry Pi, so I was not able to install Ruby as quickly as planned. Details below.</p>

<h3>Installing Rails</h3>

<p>I will have to cover Ruby and Rails installation in a future blog post because my initial attempts were not successful. <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">RVM, Ruby, and Rails installed easily with Raspberry Pi</a>, even though the compilation time was long. With the BeagleBone Black, I received the following in response to the <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
sh-4.2# curl -L <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable &mdash;ruby
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current</p>

<pre><code>                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
</code></pre>

<p>  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash;     0
curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)
sh-4.2#
```</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to try <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBEnv</a>? I&rsquo;ll post a solution when I find it. Or&hellip; if a reader of this blog already has a solution for the BeagleBone Black Rails installation challenge, please post in the comments below and I&rsquo;ll credit you here.</p>

<h4>BeagleBone Black vs. Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Which is better, BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi? There&rsquo;s no clear winner in my opinion. It&rsquo;s a matter of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone runs Linux right out of the box, while it takes some time to get Linux running on the Pi, unless you buy a card pre-configured for the Pi.</li>
<li>RVM, Ruby, and Rails installation was painless on the Pi even though compilation time was long. The jury is still out w/r/t RVM on the &lsquo;Bone.</li>
<li>Cost-wise, they&rsquo;re within ten bucks of each other. That&rsquo;s a wash.</li>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone has more Ardunio-like provisions for digital projects.</li>
<li>The Pi includes an RCA output for older TVs. Plus the Pi uses standard HDMI, so there&rsquo;s no need to get a special micro-HDMI cable.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve owned my &lsquo;Bone for just over 24 hours. Lots more to learn. Looking forward to it!</p>

    <updated>2013-05-16T13:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rvm.io">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Ruby ecosystem.  Reason: RVM lets me experiment with Ruby and Rails at will. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my best experiments are full of risk so they eventually blow things up. When that happens, I can always recover the broken areas without wasting time on a full system restore.</p>

<p>Some devs choose to use another tool, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBenv</a>, that serves a purpose similar to RVM. I began working with RVM before the other tools existed, and since it has always worked well for me, I have no reason to switch.</p>

<h4>Ruby 2.0.0-p195</h4>

<p>The latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0, p195, was released two days ago. Time to take it for a spin. RVM lets devs upgrade Ruby and manage gemsets seamlessly. Here&rsquo;s how the process went.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Get the Latest RVM</h4>

<p>Instructions for installing RVM are at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.
If you already have RVM installed, you should confirm that you have the
latest version.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm get head
</code></p>

<h4>Grab the Ruby Patch</h4>

<p>With the latest RVM installed, you can upgrade to the latest Ruby
patch level.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm upgrade 2.0.0
Are you sure you wish to upgrade from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195? (Y/n): y
Installing new ruby ruby-2.0.0-p195
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
</code></p>

<p>The process took at least twenty minutes on my system. I don&rsquo;t have an exact time because I began working on other tasks during the upgrade, and when I looked back at the terminal window, the process was mostly complete, except for a few questions about gemsets&hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
Migrating gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Are you sure you wish to MOVE gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195?
This will overwrite existing gems in ruby-2.0.0-p195 and remove them from ruby-2.0.0-p0 (Y/n): y
Moving gemsets...
</code>
&hellip;and aliases, wrappers, and archiving my patchless Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<p>```bash
Do you wish to move over aliases? (Y/n): y
Do you wish to move over wrappers? (Y/n): y
Do you also wish to completely remove ruby-2.0.0-p0 (inc. archive)? (Y/n): y
Removing ruby-2.0.0-p0&hellip;&hellip;..
Successfully migrated ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Upgrade complete!</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Upgrade complete. Now running the latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>As a final option, I chose to make this latest Ruby patch my default.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>~$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0 &mdash;default
Using /Users/rth/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]
=* ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>~$
```
And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/04/20/ack-written-in-perl-useful-with-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-20T17:12:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/04/20/ack-written-in-perl-useful-with-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ack.png" align="right" height="237" width="230" alt="Ack Linux Mac OS X" title="Ack Linux Mac OS X"></p>

<p><a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">Ack</a> is an open source command line tool that lets developers search large trees of source code very quickly. If you are looking for a method definition in a haystack of files, Ack will find that needle for you. Many devs regard Ack as a replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>.</p>

<p>The Elmhurst <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> meetings are always a source of unexpected learning. Today ChicagoRuby welcomed <a href="http://twitter.com/petdance">Andy Lester</a>, creator of Ack. Andy released Ack 2.0 two days ago. He shared some of the latest features in an impromptu demo.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Why Ack?</h4>

<p>Have you ever been working on a project, only to be interrupted when you need to look for something? It could be a method name, a variable declaration, or a string of text in a comment. A minor distraction costs you the time it takes to search plus the time required to re-focus.</p>

<p>All of us are more productive when we stay <em>in the zone</em>. Ack helps devs to maintain focus and thereby produce better results.</p>

<h4>First, Install Perl</h4>

<p>Ack requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> programming language. Perl comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and most Linux distros. If you&rsquo;re running on a &lsquo;nix platform, you probably have Perl already.</p>

<p>Windows installations are beyond the scope of this article. If you&rsquo;re running Windows, you might consider a Linux VM for Ruby and Rails-related work.</p>

<h4>Installing Ack on Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Installing Ack is so easy that it almost feels wrong: Grab Ack in a single Perl file and drop it in your <code>~/bin/</code> directory. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Ack can also be installed via <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, but I prefer the <em>drop it in ~/bin</em> installation since everything is contained in one file. Here&rsquo;s a more detailed version of the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have one already, create <code>~/bin/</code> as a subdirectory of your home directory.</li>
<li>Grab a the single-file copy of Ack from <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">http://beyondgrep.com/ </a></li>
<li>Drop the single-file copy of Ack into a file called <code>~/bin/ack</code></li>
<li>Make sure that <code>$HOME/bin:</code> appears at the beginning of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ol>


<p>At this point you should be running Ack v2.0 or later. To verify:</p>

<p>```bash
~/bin$ ack &mdash;version
ack 2.02 (git commit f3c8827)
Running under Perl 5.12.4 at /usr/bin/perl</p>

<p>Copyright 2005-2013 Andy Lester.</p>

<p>This program is free software.  You may modify or distribute it
under the terms of the Artistic License v2.0.</p>

<p>~/bin$
```</p>

<p>Installation complete. Now, let&rsquo;s take Ack for a spin.</p>

<h4>Using Ack at the Command Line</h4>

<p>For a sample project, let&rsquo;s use <code>demo_app</code> from Michael Hartl&rsquo;s <a href="http://rubyonrailstutorial.com">Ruby on
Rails Tutorial</a>. Imagine that you want
to find every file in the project that references <code>user_id</code>. How would
you do that?
<img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/ack_user_id.png" align="center" height="650" width="887" alt="Ack command line demo" title="Ack command line demo"></p>

<p>Fast, clear, and highlighted in color. Bonus: If you&rsquo;re a Vim user,
try <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">ack.vim</a> if you want to run Ack
without leaving your editor.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Ack helps devs to find things quicker without leaving the zone. Try it!</p>
