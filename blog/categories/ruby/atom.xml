<a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a>&rsquo;s OS X support enabled me to solve a small problem yesterday.  Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>

<h3>Background on Backup</h3>

<p>No matter how much money we spend on computers, the data we create is worth more. The best data protection employs several levels of redundancy.</p>

<p>My backup system starts with Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#timemachinebasics">Time Machine</a>, which handles first level backups painlessly in the background. Time machine is even more effective when multiple disks are used. I like to combine that with online solutions. Redundancy is a good thing.</p>

<p>USB-attached drives work great with Time Machine. I found that Time Machine was inconsistent over WiFi, and when it failed, troubleshooting took too much time. That was a few years ago and things have probably improved since then. I&rsquo;ve never had to troubleshoot a USB-attached Time Machine drive. USB just works. Except when it doesn&rsquo;t. And that&rsquo;s where RubyMotion proved helpful.</p>

<h3>Disconnecting USB in a Hurry</h3>

<p>My only problem with USB-attached drives comes when I need to leave my desk in a hurry. You may have seen this message before:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/disk-not-ejected-properly.png' width='' height='' alt='In a hurry to eject?' title='In a hurry to eject?'><span class='caption-text'>In a hurry to eject?</span></span></p>

<p>All three of my USB drives are attached through a single USB hub. Yanking the cable while running for a meeting isâ€¦ bad! Forgetting to eject even one of the USB drives is also bad.</p>

<p>I solved the problem about a year ago by writing a command line tool that ejects all three drives with one double-click of an icon. Yesterday I deciced to improve my command line tool with RubyMotion.</p>

<h3>Ejecting in a Hurry</h3>

<p><code>EjectDisks</code> is a simple OS X program written with the RubyMotion toolchain for Mac OS X. It uses the <code>osx-status-bar-app-template</code> gem created by <a href="https://github.com/kickcode/osx-status-bar-app-template">Elliott Draper</a>. Here&rsquo;s a 10-second demo.</p>

<center><iframe name="eject-disks-osx" src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/78349497" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The latest version of the EjectDisk code is on <a href="https://github.com/RayHightower/EjectDisks">GitHub</a>. The <code>app_delegate.rb</code> file appears below.</p>

<p>```ruby
class AppDelegate
  attr_accessor :status_menu</p>

<p>  def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)</p>

<pre><code>@app_name = NSBundle.mainBundle.infoDictionary['CFBundleDisplayName']

@status_menu = NSMenu.new

@status_item = NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar.statusItemWithLength(NSVariableStatusItemLength).init
@status_item.setMenu(@status_menu)
@status_item.setHighlightMode(true)
@status_item.setTitle(@app_name)

@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("About #{@app_name}", 'orderFrontStandardAboutPanel:')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Custom Action", 'pressAction')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Eject Three Disks", 'ejectThreeDisks')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Say Something", 'sayDroid')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Sing", 'singSomething')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Greetings", 'greetings')
@status_menu.addItem createMenuItem("Quit", 'terminate:')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def createMenuItem(name, action)</p>

<pre><code>NSMenuItem.alloc.initWithTitle(name, action: action, keyEquivalent: '')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def pressAction</p>

<pre><code>alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
alert.setMessageText "Action triggered from status bar menu"
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def sayDroid</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello droid)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def singSomething</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def greetings</p>

<pre><code>%x(say -v cello Greetings to the members of Chippewa Valley Code Camp &amp;)
alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
alert.setMessageText "Greetings to the members of Chippewa Valley Code Camp!"
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def ejectThreeDisks</p>

<pre><code>alert = NSAlert.alloc.init
response = %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject SiiGBlack) + "\n"
response += %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject Ultra3TB) + "\n"
response += %x(/usr/sbin/diskutil eject WDSilver) + "\n"
alert.setMessageText response
alert.addButtonWithTitle "OK"
alert.runModal
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Not everything in the EjectDisks tool is business-related. Do we really need to include a greeting to the members of the <a href="http://chippewavalleycodecamp.com/">Chippewa Valley Code Camp</a>?  Yes, we do!</p>

<p>On the serious side, the app should handle disk ejection as a background process. It&rsquo;s not good to tie up the system for a simple task. Look for a forked process in a future version of the app.</p>

Planet Earth is facing a shortage of people who make things. People like scientists, software developers, architects, and  engineers. People who use their brains and hands to make greatness happen.</p>

<p>To increase the world&rsquo;s supply of problem solvers, the organizers of <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> partnered with a group of energetic college students, the founders of <a href="http://hackthemonkey.com">Monkey Bars</a>. The result: Together, we launched the first WindyCityRails Youth Program featuring the Arduino microcontroller.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Video Summary</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the launch video:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/74022351" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The youth who participated in the program were engaged and enthusiastic. The Monkey Bars team introduced the youth to the Arduino micro-controller and related hardware.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, parents arrived to take their kids home, and the kids were reluctant to leave! They were absorbed in their Arduino projects. Even better, friendships formed between the youth participants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to think about the new companies that may have been launched that day!</p>

<h3>Next Year</h3>

<p>Planning for next year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails, including the Youth Program, is currently underway. If there are things you&rsquo;d like to see in next year&rsquo;s program, feel free to <a href="http://windycityrails.org/contact">contact the WindyCityRails organizers</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-25T01:14:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/08/25/madison-ruby-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/madison-ruby.png' width='' height='' alt='Madison Ruby 2011 T-Shirt Design by Mike Rohde' title='Madison Ruby 2011 T-Shirt Design by Mike Rohde'><span class='caption-text'>Madison Ruby 2011 T-Shirt Design by Mike Rohde</span></span>
<a href="http://madisonruby.com">Madison Ruby</a> 2013 was held this weekend. The conference attracts smart, intellectually curious people who are thirsty to learn more.</p>

<p>By the way, Madison Ruby was a lot of fun, too!</p>

<h3>Speakers: Impressive and Accessible</h3>

<p>First, lets cover the obvious high points so we can focus on those things that make Madison Ruby unique. Organizers <a href="https://twitter.com/jremsikjr">Jim</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/JenRemsik">Jen Remsik</a> have solidified their reputation for choosing engaging, well-prepared speakers. The Remsik network of speakers includes accomplished developers from around the world. Many are published authors. Some, like <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/">Danielle Lee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/marteeeen">Martin Atkins</a>, excel in fields outside of software development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What the presenters have in common: All are high achievers. All are inspiring. All take time to stick around after their time on stage to interact with attendees. That kind of interaction makes the Madison Ruby community work.</p>

<h3>Community in Madison</h3>

<p>Madison Ruby is unique in the way it brings the local community into the event. Local business and community leaders speak at the conference. The local leaders are enthusiastic about Madison and they engage attendees. One year, a farmer shared her experience growing up in a cheese-producing family business. This year, a biomedical engineering graduate of the University of Wisconsin encouraged the audience to build our creative muscles by having fun. She drove the point home with a hula-hoop demonstration, followed with a <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/classes/german-wheel/">German Wheel</a> performance by a colleague.</p>

<p>People from other worlds speaking at a software conference&hellip; it works.</p>

<h3>Meal Time</h3>

<p>Lunch was served by the entire Madison restaurant community. Gift certificates were supplied by Engine Yard, and the certificates were redeemable for meals at local restaurants.  What a wonderful way to put serendipity to work! Attendees who just met formed clusters of lunch parties on a whim. The conversations were rich.</p>

<h3>After-Hours Gatherings</h3>

<p>Thursday night&rsquo;s gathering, <a href="http://hypeharvest.com/">Hype Harvest</a>, had elements of a party but it was so much more. Hype Harvest was held on the roof of the Madison Museum of Modern Art, and it served multiple purposes. First, to raise funds for Nairobi Dev School, founded by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/tech/teenager-hacker-school-africa-google">Martha Chumo</a>, a 19-year-old software developer in Nairobi, Kenya. Second, to give everyone a taste of the presenters to come. Third, to let the attendees gather, renew old friendships, and begin new ones.</p>

<p>Friday night&rsquo;s party was held at <a href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>. An outdoor concert ran concurrently in the middle of the street next to the office. Bendyworks guests had the best seats around because the second floor office sits right above the musical stage.</p>

<h3>Madison Ruby and My Brother</h3>

<p>As an organizer of WindyCityRails, my relationship with Madison Ruby reminds me of my relationship with my brother, <a href="http://motoringventures.com">Edward Hightower</a>, while we were growing up. Edward and I are one year apart, and we competed aggressively in every way: On the swim team, in the <a href="http://troop534.org">Boy Scouts</a>, in academics&hellip; you name it. Through the competition, we learned to love and respect each other. My brother Edward is one of my closest friends. That doesn&rsquo;t always happen with family!</p>

<p>Madison Ruby competes with WindyCityRails. At the same time, I enjoy the trip to Madison because I get so much from the experience. Congratulations to the Madison Ruby organizer team for running a great event three years in a row. I plan to return next year.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is a lean blogging engine that happens to power <a href="http://rayhightower.com">RayHightower.com</a>. Earlier today, after a quick update to the blog, I encountered the following:</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ rake generate

</code></pre>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Not good. What happened?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>From the error message, it appeared that my current version of Bundler was incompatible with Octopress. Googling for the error message (a favorite trick) was unhelpful. Had to try a different line of attack.</p>

<h3>The Solution: Roll Back</h3>

<p>Fortunately, I use <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a>. Currently installed versions of Ruby:</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   jruby-1.7.3 [ x86_64 ]
   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p448 [ x86_64 ]
=* ruby-2.0.0-p247 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Since <code>$ rake deploy</code> last worked with Ruby 1.9.2 on my machine, I decided to roll back to that point.</p>

<p>```bash
$ rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p290</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next, I built another <code>octopress</code> gemset to work with this version of Ruby, pointed to the gemset, and used Bundler to add the necessary gems.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm gemset create octopress
$ rvm gemset use octopress
$ bundle install
</code></p>

<p>And now <code>$ rake generate</code> works as required.</p>

<p>```bash
$ rake generate</p>

<h2>Generating Site with Jekyll</h2>

<p>identical source/stylesheets/screen.css
Configuration from /Users/rth/Code/Ruby/apps/rayhightower/_config.yml
Building site: source &ndash;> public
Successfully generated site: source &ndash;> public
```</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<h3>RVM Saves the Day</h3>

<p>Once again, RVM lets me recover quickly by shifting to an earlier version of Ruby. What&rsquo;s the root cause of the problem? I don&rsquo;t know at this point. But for now, the blog is up &amp; running!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-22T22:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack.jpg" width="372" height="600" title="BeagleBone Black" alt="BeagleBone Black" align="right">
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a>, like the <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, is a small, inexpensive computer that runs Linux. It&rsquo;s smaller than a deck of cards and you can buy one for about forty-five dollars ($45.00). The device is made by <a href="http://circuitco.com">CircuitCo</a> in Richardson, TX, USA.</p>

<h3>It Just Works</h3>

<p>BeagleBone Black runs Linux right out of the box. Steps required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in the micro-HDMI cable for the monitor. See the &ldquo;Gotchas&rdquo;
section about micro-HDMI below.</li>
<li>Plug in the keyboard &amp; mouse via the USB port. You might need a USB hub because the board only has one USB port.</li>
<li>Add power via the mini-USB port or the 5v power connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a few minutes of boot time, we have a fully-functioning Linux computer with a GUI, Firefox browser, and other tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The BeagleBone Black has 2GB of flash storage on the board, and part
of that is used for Linux. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot after just a few minutes of ownership.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-WindyCityRails.png" width="600" height="338" title="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" alt="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" align="center"></center>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-USB.png" width="250" height="200" title="BeagleBone Black USB" alt="BeagleBone Black USB" align="right">
All of the paper documentation for the BeagleBone Black fits on a slip of paper roughly the size of two business cards. The meat of the documentation resides on the device itself. To reach the electronic documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the BeagleBone Black into a USB port on your laptop.</li>
<li>The board will appear as a USB storage device. One of the files at the
root of the storage device, <code>START.htm</code>, contains the documentation. It
can be viewed in a web browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The documentation recommends against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">MSIE</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/micro-HDMI-home-depot.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Micro HDMI Home Depot" alt="Micro HDMI Home Depot" align="right">
The manufacturer included a mini-USB cable with the device, so you can power it up right after you rip open the package. Gotcha: You need a micro-HDMI cable (or adapter) if you want to attach a monitor. I would have preferred a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapater in the box instead of the mini-USB cable. That&rsquo;s a little nit-picky on my part since micro-HDMI cables are easy to find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to Home Depot: Their store-brand cables let you test the cable end without opening the package, right in the store. Excellent package design by Home Depot.</p>

<p>My second &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; is more important: The <code>curl</code> command did not behave as flawlessly as it did with the Raspberry Pi, so I was not able to install Ruby as quickly as planned. Details below.</p>

<h3>Installing Rails</h3>

<p>I will have to cover Ruby and Rails installation in a future blog post because my initial attempts were not successful. <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">RVM, Ruby, and Rails installed easily with Raspberry Pi</a>, even though the compilation time was long. With the BeagleBone Black, I received the following in response to the <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
sh-4.2# curl -L <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable &mdash;ruby
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current</p>

<pre><code>                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
</code></pre>

<p>  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash;     0
curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)
sh-4.2#
```</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to try <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBEnv</a>? I&rsquo;ll post a solution when I find it. Or&hellip; if a reader of this blog already has a solution for the BeagleBone Black Rails installation challenge, please post in the comments below and I&rsquo;ll credit you here.</p>

<h4>BeagleBone Black vs. Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Which is better, BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi? There&rsquo;s no clear winner in my opinion. It&rsquo;s a matter of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone runs Linux right out of the box, while it takes some time to get Linux running on the Pi, unless you buy a card pre-configured for the Pi.</li>
<li>RVM, Ruby, and Rails installation was painless on the Pi even though compilation time was long. The jury is still out w/r/t RVM on the &lsquo;Bone.</li>
<li>Cost-wise, they&rsquo;re within ten bucks of each other. That&rsquo;s a wash.</li>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone has more Ardunio-like provisions for digital projects.</li>
<li>The Pi includes an RCA output for older TVs. Plus the Pi uses standard HDMI, so there&rsquo;s no need to get a special micro-HDMI cable.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve owned my &lsquo;Bone for just over 24 hours. Lots more to learn. Looking forward to it!</p>
