    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From a video interview with Steve Jobs:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little money.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.<!--more--></p>

<p>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people who are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build other things that other people can use.</p>

<p>Once you learn that, you&rsquo;ll never be the same again.</p></blockquote>

Age has little to do with ability. Every profession has examples of people who achieve goals even though others consider them <em>too young</em> or <em>too old</em>. People who excel in the face of stereotypes are exciting to watch.</p>

<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> listed some examples in a 1980s-era ad for United Technologies Corporation.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s what you do &ndash; not when you do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ted Williams, at age 42, slammed a home run in his last official at bat.</li>
<li>Mickey Mantle, age 20, hit 23 home runs in his first full year in the major leagues.</li>
<li>Golda Meir was 71 when she became Prime Minister of Israel.</li>
<li>William Pitt II was 24 when he became Prime Minister of Great Britain.</li>
<li>George Bernard Shaw was 94 when one of his plays was first produced.</li>
<li>Mozart was just seven when his first composition was published.</li>
<li>Now, how about this? Benjamin Franklin was a newspaper columnist at 16, a framer of The United States Constitution at 81, and a scientist throughout his life.</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re never too young or too old if you&rsquo;ve got talent. Let&rsquo;s recognize that age has little to do with ability.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> is on a mission. Technology enables us to form communities that stretch beyond traditional boundaries like age and social status. Godin is convinced that revolutions within and between communities will yield huge opportunities for those who have the courage to take action. Don’t waste the revolution!</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to hear Godin speak at a Chicago area event some time ago. This post was inspired by the presentation.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Recognizing Change</h3>

<p>Humans rarely recognize change when we’re in the middle of it. We’re too busy living! One example from Chicago history: The advent of the skyscraper. On the surface, a skyscraper is just a tall building… big deal. However, in hindsight we can see that the skyscraper (and the Chicago school of architecture) in the late 1880s led to the expansion of cities. Cities became magnets for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>. As cities grew to accommodate more people, political power shifted away from farms and toward urban areas. Professional service firms, companies that exist to make other companies better, blossomed &amp; grew. We continue to feel the effects of this trend today, over a century later.</p>

<p>Godin believes that we are now dealing with another catalyst of change, one that is even more powerful than the skyscraper: the community. Communities are growing in size and power. Companies that know how to leverage communities are thriving.</p>

<h3>Threadless is Not About T-Shirts</h3>

<p>Fast forward to the early 21st century where we find a Chicago-area company called Threadless. If you sell a product that is easily copied, how do you differentiate yourself from the competition? By selling something that goes beyond the easily cloned product. <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless</a> has created a community around T-shirt sales. When building the company, the founders of Threadless looked at available technology and asked themselves, “What do people really want?” Their answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be famous.</li>
<li>To be recognized.</li>
<li>To be talked about.</li>
</ul>


<p>So they built the company to fulfill these basic human needs. If you’re an artist, submit a design. If enough people vote for your design, it gets printed on a shirt. And while you’re looking around the Threadless site, you’re welcome to buy any of the other designs for about $20 each.</p>

<p>While other t-shirt companies are trying to undercut each other on price, Threadless gives customers what they really want, customers gladly pay a premium, and everybody wins.</p>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/rails_logo.jpg" width="200" height="285" align="right" title="Ruby on Rails Logo" alt="Ruby on Rails Logo"></p>

<h3>We Don’t Pay for Software. We Pay for Results</h3>

<p>Godin cites <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> as an example of a company that nutures a community of software developers by giving away software for free. 37signals extracted the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework from their Basecamp project management tool. Rather than charge for Rails, the company makes it available to the open source community at no charge. 37signals benefits because the people who use Rails, software developers, end up trying, buying and recommending the paid products to their colleagues. This results in an upward spiral in revenue for the company. To top it off, 37signals benefits from the open source community in ways that are not easily measured in dollars.</p>

<p>WisdomGroup is grateful to the entire Ruby on Rails community, including 37signals. We express our gratitude through <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> and <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>. Contributing to the open source community has enabled us to develop wonderful relationships with contractors, clients, advisors… all sorts of people who have helped us to grow &amp; prosper. User groups and conferences enable the software community to come together – creating something far beyond the grasp of an individual genius.</p>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>Seth Godin’s point: Our most successful companies are built around communities. Companies that know how to build &amp; nurture communities will thrive &amp; grow. Companies stuck in the old paradigm (massive advertising on a massive scale) might survive, but they will be easily eclipsed by companies that understand the value of strong communities. The revolution is here, and Seth Godin urges all of us not to waste it.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-21T18:52:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/06/21/replacing-google-reader-with-feed-wrangler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/feedwrangler-gil.jpg" height="600" width="450" align="right" alt="Google Reader Replacement: Feed Wrangler - iPad" title="Google Reader Replacement: Feed Wrangler - iPad">
Google Reader, the RSS product, shuts down on July 1st. I consume most news via RSS, and the ability to sync multiple RSS clients between iPhone, iPad, and desktop with Google Reader in the background saved time while keeping me informed. Finding a replacement is critical.</p>

<p>Fortunately, strong alternatives are emerging. <a href="http://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> is a Google Reader replacement by independent developer <a href="http://david-smith.org">David Smith</a>. Here are my first impressions.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>After using the service for a few hours, I can already see some things that I like. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal fluff. Other RSS clients feature big photos and page-flipping special effects. That&rsquo;s not for me. Just the facts, RSS.</li>
<li>Easy RSS import from Google Reader. Just log in with your Google account and follow the prompts. After you import your feeds into Feed Wrangler&rsquo;s web app, you will never need Google Reader again.</li>
<li>Reasonable cost. The Feed Wrangler service costs $19/year. Google dropped Reader because they couldn&rsquo;t make money from the free product. You can&rsquo;t fix that with volume! When an app makes money (directly or indirectly) then the app is more likely to stick around.</li>
<li>iPhone and iPad apps. Feed Wrangler&rsquo;s native apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feed-wrangler/id634486174?mt=8">iPhone and iPad</a> sync with the web app. This is important for me because I consume most RSS on-the-go. A screenshot from the iPad app appears above.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Like most users, I want the developer to add &ldquo;just one or two more features&rdquo; to make the app perfect for me. Of course that&rsquo;s the slippery slope to bloatware since every user has a different set of one-or-two features.</p>

<p>The developer can avoid bloatware by ignoring all other users and focusing on <em>my</em> feature requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evernote integration. My current RSS client lets me drop an article into Evernote with a few taps on the screen. Sometimes I want to re-read an article or think about it more deeply at a later time. Evernote lets me do this.</li>
<li>Organized imports. While Feed Wrangler imports feeds from Google Reader, it does not maintain Reader&rsquo;s organization. So I had to organize my feeds manually with Feed Wrangler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smart Stream&rdquo; feature. If Reader&rsquo;s folders could be imported as Feed Wrangler&rsquo;s Smart Streams, that would be cool.</li>
<li>Feed counter. Sometimes I prioritize my reading by the number of unread articles. A counter next to each feed would be helpful.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I plan to try other RSS readers before Google Reader shuts down on July 1st. Feed Wrangler is making a good impression so far.</p>

<em>Note: This timeless story pre-dates the web, and it has appeared at <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup.com</a>. Author unknown.</em></p>

<p>There was a man who lived by the side of the road and sold hot dogs. He was hard of hearing, so he had no radio. He had trouble with his eyes, so he read no newspaper. But he sold good hot dogs. He put signs up on the highway telling how good they were. He stood on the side of the road and cried &ldquo;Buy a hot dog, mister?&rdquo; And people bought. He increased his meat and bun orders. He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade.</p>

<p>One day, his son came home from college to help him out. <!--more--> The son said, &ldquo;Father, haven’t you been listening to the radio? Haven’t you been reading the newspaper? There’s a big recession. The European situation is terrible. The domestic situation is worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the father thought, &ldquo;Well, my son has been to college. He reads the papers and listens to the radio. He ought to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders, took down his advertising signs, and no longer bothered to stand out on the highway to sell his hot dogs.</p>

<p>Hot dog sales fell almost overnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You’re right, son,&rdquo; the father said. &ldquo;We are certainly in the middle of a great recession.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>

<p>Whether times are good or bad, all of us must ask ourselves: What role is played by self-fulfilling prophesy?</p>

<p>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</p>
