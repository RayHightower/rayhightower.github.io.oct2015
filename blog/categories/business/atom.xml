<br/>&nbsp;
~Elon Musk</p></blockquote>

<p>Elon Musk shared some interesting thoughts during the April 30th announcement for <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall">Tesla Energy</a>. Two charts stood out in particular.</p>

<h3>Solar Panels Required</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/tesla_blue_square_energy.png' width='' height='' alt='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.' title='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.'><span class='caption-text'>From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.</span></span></p>

<p>Take a look at the map of the United States, above. A blue square has been drawn in the northwest corner of Texas. At map scale, solar panels with combined surface area equal to the blue square could meet all of the electricity needs of the USA. And we’re the most power hungry country on the planet!</p>

<h3>Batteries Required</h3>

<p>Solar panels are useless at night and on cloudy days. Fortunately, we can store excess energy on sunny days if we have the right kind of batteries. Tesla happens to make those batteries, hence the Tesla Energy announcement.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/tesla_batteries.png' width='' height='' alt='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.' title='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.'><span class='caption-text'>From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.</span></span></p>

<p>The second map is drawn at a larger scale than the first one. For reference, the blue square covers the same surface area as before. At map scale, all of the batteries required to store reserve solar energy would fit inside the red dot.</p>

<p>What are we waiting for?</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Warren. He&rsquo;s Charlie. He can hear, I can see. We work well together.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
~Warren Buffett,<br/>at the start of the 2015<br/>Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://berkshirehathaway.com">Berkshire Hathaway</a> held its 50th annual shareholder meeting on May 2, 2015. The company is a lesson in successful capitalism. Chairman Warren Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger have built the most successful investment partnership in human history. The list of wholly-owned Berkshire subsidiaries includes GEICO, Fruit of the Loom, Brooks Shoes, and See&rsquo;s Candies. The company also owns large percentages of Coca Cola (9.16%), American Express (14.9%), IBM (7.82%), and Wells Fargo (9.01%).</p>

<p>Over 40,000 shareholders attended Saturday&rsquo;s annual meeting. What draws so many shareholders to Omaha every year? The opportunity to learn.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Meeting, In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>The formal shareholders meeting only lasts fifteen minutes, from 3:30pm to 3:45pm. For the rest of the day (excluding an hour for lunch) Buffett (age 84) and Munger (age 91) answer questions from journalists, financial analysts, and randomly selected members of the audience.</p>

<p>The day starts at 8:30am with a movie.</p>

<h3>Morning Movie</h3>

<p>Each Berkshire meeting starts with a short movie. One year, the movie included information about a recent acquisition, a deal that had been completed just hours before the meeting. This year&rsquo;s movie was a humorous montage of skits worthy of Saturday Night Live, woven with ads for Berkshire products. Berkshire brought in Hollywood director John Landis to direct this year&rsquo;s opening movie. One skit included a boxing match between Buffett and Floyd Mayweather. Charlie Rose interviewed the pugilists before their bout. Mayweather and Rose played themselves in the skit.</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

<p>Buffest and Munger answer questions from the stage while sipping Coke and munching See&rsquo;s candy. Their answers tend to be short and direct, laced with wit. Snippets of wisdom from the Q &amp; A session:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Buffett: Investing is easy if you can control your emotions.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger: I quit practicing law. Law firms are like a pie eating contest where if you win, you get to eat a lot more pie.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffett: When it comes to investing, I prefer to be 100x too cautious, rather than 1x un-cautious.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger: Both of us hate the idea of losing someone else&rsquo;s money. It drives our caution.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger: People want value when they buy something. But when they invest, they go for the quick fix. I don&rsquo;t understand that.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger (When asked if he would have preferred to be born in 2015 instead of 1924): I don&rsquo;t like these overly theoretical questions. I&rsquo;d rather answer questions where I can actively help somebody.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffett (summarizing capitalism): Do what you&rsquo;re best at. Let other people do what they&rsquo;re best at.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffett (on his long term perspective): I get monthly reports from all our companies and I read them with great interest. We don&rsquo;t ignore monthly or yearly results. We just don&rsquo;t live by them.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger (When asked about Berkshire&rsquo;s interest in investing in Germany): Germans work fewer hours and produce a lot more. We&rsquo;d like to invest in Germany, but it&rsquo;s difficult to penetrate family company ownership structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffett (When asked about the NetJets pilots picketing outside the annual meeting): We have hundreds of labor unions in BRK. Three strikes in fifty years. Employees and employers sometimes disagree regarding pay. That&rsquo;s human nature. We will resolve this disagreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger (Predicting why the Euro will eventually fail): You can&rsquo;t form a business partnership with your thriftless, drunken brother in law.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger (On BRK borrowing money): We haven&rsquo;t felt cash constrained in a long time. We would love to have an acquisition large enough to require us to borrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffett (On giving up his private jet vs quitting the Internet): If I had to give up my plane or the Internet, I&rsquo;d give up the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Munger (On why he and Buffett are so successful): We owe a considerable amount to the families we were raised in. We had great role models.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Giving Credit for Success</h3>

<p>Throughout the Q &amp; A period, Buffett praised several of the Berkshire managers by name. When a questioner said something good about American Express, Buffett praised Ken Chenault. When someone had positive words about Berkshire&rsquo;s insurance holdings, Buffett credited Ajit Jain. Buffett and Munger share the credit for Berkshire&rsquo;s performance. That&rsquo;s a big reason why the companies perform so well.</p>

<h3>Meeting People</h3>

<p>When 40,000 investment-minded people gather, rich conversations will happen. After the meeting, I ended up having dinner with an asset manager from Brazil. Both of us arrived solo at Gorat&rsquo;s, Buffett&rsquo;s favorite steakhouse in Omaha. We decided to share a table when we realized that Gorat&rsquo;s would seat a table for two faster than two tables for one. Capitalism, properly practiced, is about cooperation.</p>

<h3>5k Run</h3>

<p>About 1,000 people gathered for the 5k <em>Invest in Yourself</em> run on Sunday morning. The weather was perfect.</p>

<h3>Looking Forward to the Next One</h3>

<p>The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting offers an inspiring, powerful learning experience each year. I look forward to the next one.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button">Amazon Dash Button</a> is for customers who crave instant gratification. We might think of Dash as a brilliant blend of the Staples Easy Button, WiFi, and Amazon&rsquo;s existing database of credit card numbers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>When a customer runs out of a consumable item, they press a button. The order is sent immediately via WiFi to Amazon, where the customer&rsquo;s credit card number is on file. Delivery can happen within 24 hours, depending on the item. No more standing in line at the store. In fact, no more walking a few feet to a computer to type in an order. Instant gratification, satisfied.</p>

<h3>Video Summary</h3>

<p>This 1-minute video explains the service with just a few words, and plenty of images.</p>

<h3>Innovation for You</h3>

<p>Kudos to Amazon for combining some existing pieces to create something new. Most inspiring for anyone who needs to innovate.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-12T16:42:49-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/03/12/apple-car-not-likely</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.
<br/>~Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway</p></blockquote>

<p>Some journalists speculate that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/19/apple-electric-car-team/">Apple is building a car</a> because they recently hired some automotive engineers away from Tesla. My prediction: Apple is <em>not</em> building a car. Apple might build a device that plays a major role in the automotive marketplace. But a fully assembled automobile is too far outside the company&rsquo;s <em>circle of competence</em>, as Charlie Munger might say. Apple succeeds because the company maintains disciplined focus within its circle of competence.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>AppleTV as an Example</h3>

<p>Case in point: AppleTV. Pundits predicted an AppleTV with a large LCD display, in a form factor that might be built by Samsung or Sony. But instead, Apple created a black set-top box about the size of a hockey puck. Apple focused on those parts of the television ecosystem that are most closely tied to their circle of competence:</p>

<ul>
<li>User experience</li>
<li>Internet connectivity</li>
<li>Content delivery</li>
</ul>


<p>Apple entered the television marketplace while remaining within its circle of competence. Even better: Content delivery is a cash flow engine that generates revenue for as long as Apple can push bits down the wire.</p>

<h3>iPhone Example</h3>

<p>When Apple entered the mobile phone market, they focused within their circle of competence.</p>

<ul>
<li>User experience for computing devices, using a subset of Mac OS X.</li>
<li>Internet connectivity via WiFi.</li>
<li>Content delivery (iTunes).</li>
</ul>


<p>In the area where Apple lacked experience, mobile network management, they partnered with an industry veteran (initially AT&amp;T). By focusing within its circle of competence, Apple was able to negotiate aggressive terms with AT&amp;T, terms which included <em>no carrier branding on the physical device</em>. Later, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and all of the other major players begged for the same deal as AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>And, as with AppleTV, content delivery is an engine that prints money for as long as Apple can push bits over the radio waves.</p>

<h3>Apple&rsquo;s Automotive Entry</h3>

<p>Apple will not build a fully assembled automobile. They&rsquo;re more likely to create an auto-related device that leverages their existing circle of competence. Something that shows off their skills with user experience, Internet connectivity, and content delivery.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s automotive content delivery offering will be interesting. The company currently offers maps and directions. What&rsquo;s next&hellip; maintenance data? Entertainment? How about a &ldquo;find my car&rdquo; serivce for those of us who forget where we park at the shopping mall.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s automotive device will fit well within the company&rsquo;s circle of competence. And Apple fans will line up around the block to buy it.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/01/22/context-changes-everything/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-22T17:48:08-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/01/22/context-changes-everything</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some cases where time zone information is absolutely critical. For example: When scheduling a video conference that crosses national boundaries.</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Google sent me a reminder about today&rsquo;s <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a> meeting. The group meets via video conferencing software over the web. Google&rsquo;s reminder was confusing because it showed the time without the time zone (screenshot below). LinuxBarbados is based in the Caribbean, and some of the members participate from other time zones.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/GH_time_zone_arrow.png' width='' height='' alt='What time is it when the time zone is unknown?' title='What time is it when the time zone is unknown?'><span class='caption-text'>What time is it when the time zone is unknown?</span></span></p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s automated reminder said <code>3pm - 4pm</code> with no time zone reference. How confusing! Members of the group received the same automated reminder with the same information, regardless of time zone. A small change, displaying the time as <code>3pm - 4pm (CST)</code> would solve the problem.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Other Context Examples</h3>

<p>When people speak with each other directly, context is implied. But when communication happens in printed form, it&rsquo;s helpful to have the context in print, too. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walking down the street, you see a poster advertising a concert on January 29th. No year is shown. Is this an old poster for a concert that happened last year on Jan 29th? Or is the event happening next week?</li>
<li>A restaurant menu offers delivery service. Just call the number, and order your food. The phone number is seven digits long, with no area code. Most customers would abandon the menu in favor of a restaurant with more complete information.</li>
<li>Following the train of thought in the previous example: Since phone service has fallen in price, many people call internationally on a more regular basis. A complete phone number should include the country code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Context changes everything. Something all of us need to remember.</p>
