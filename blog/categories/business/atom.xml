    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode of 60 Minutes featured an interview with Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. The timing was perfect for Amazon. Black Friday was a few days ago. Cyber Monday is today. Online retailers want to be top-of-mind when people are inclined to spend money.</p>

<h3>Amazon&rsquo;s Surprise: Drones</h3>

<p>Bezos unveiled a surprise for interviewer Charlie Rose: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ref_=tsm_1_tw_s_amzn_mx3eqp&amp;node=8037720011">Amazon Prime Air</a>, a service that will deliver most Amazon products in thirty minutes or less using a fleet of octocopter drones.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Marketing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.gmarketing.com/">Jay Conrad Levinson</a>, author of <em>Guerrilla Marketing</em>, would applaud this move by Amazon. Amazon Prime Air is two years away at the earliest. The flying drones require Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval, and that takes time. By unveiling the drones now, before approval, Amazon reaps several benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buzz. Everybody is talking about Amazon on Cyber Monday.</li>
<li>Political influence. Some of the people feeling the buzz are FAA officials.</li>
<li>Continued top-of-mind awareness. Long after Cyber Monday, the excitement of the drone idea will carry on.</li>
</ul>


<p>Congrats to the Amazon team for a well-executed Guerrilla Marketing move.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Teenagers are a tough audience. If you have ever spoken to a youth group, you know the challenge: Speak about something important without putting the youth to sleep. Tall order.</p>

<h3>Three Stories</h3>

<p>Boy Scout <a href="http://troop534.org">Troop 534 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</a> asked me to speak at the Troop’s annual reunion breakfast this year.  I approached them with three stories centered around the theme of <em>Specialized Knowledge and the Courage to Execute</em>. What a boring title! But the three stories appealed to the group. Here’s a summary of the first story:</p>

<blockquote><p>A tractor maker takes drastic action when when Enzo Ferrari (creator of the Ferrari sports car) pisses him off.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Gratitude</h3>

<p>This event was a big deal for me because I grew up in Troop 534 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;, I currently serve as one of the adult leaders, and the breakfast organizers normally invite an outsider to speak. Why listen to a speaker who you see all the time?</p>

<p>I took the speaking invitation as an opportunity to assemble some new material. Thank you scouts, parents, and leaders for having me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From a video interview with Steve Jobs:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little money.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.<!--more--></p>

<p>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people who are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build other things that other people can use.</p>

<p>Once you learn that, you&rsquo;ll never be the same again.</p></blockquote>

Age has little to do with ability. Every profession has examples of people who achieve goals even though others consider them <em>too young</em> or <em>too old</em>. People who excel in the face of stereotypes are exciting to watch.</p>

<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> listed some examples in a 1980s-era ad for United Technologies Corporation.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s what you do &ndash; not when you do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ted Williams, at age 42, slammed a home run in his last official at bat.</li>
<li>Mickey Mantle, age 20, hit 23 home runs in his first full year in the major leagues.</li>
<li>Golda Meir was 71 when she became Prime Minister of Israel.</li>
<li>William Pitt II was 24 when he became Prime Minister of Great Britain.</li>
<li>George Bernard Shaw was 94 when one of his plays was first produced.</li>
<li>Mozart was just seven when his first composition was published.</li>
<li>Now, how about this? Benjamin Franklin was a newspaper columnist at 16, a framer of The United States Constitution at 81, and a scientist throughout his life.</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re never too young or too old if you&rsquo;ve got talent. Let&rsquo;s recognize that age has little to do with ability.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> is on a mission. Technology enables us to form communities that stretch beyond traditional boundaries like age and social status. Godin is convinced that revolutions within and between communities will yield huge opportunities for those who have the courage to take action. Don’t waste the revolution!</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to hear Godin speak at a Chicago area event some time ago. This post was inspired by the presentation.</p>

<h3>Recognizing Change</h3>

<p>Humans rarely recognize change when we’re in the middle of it. We’re too busy living! One example from Chicago history: The advent of the skyscraper. On the surface, a skyscraper is just a tall building… big deal. However, in hindsight we can see that the skyscraper (and the Chicago school of architecture) in the late 1880s led to the expansion of cities. Cities became magnets for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>. As cities grew to accommodate more people, political power shifted away from farms and toward urban areas. Professional service firms, companies that exist to make other companies better, blossomed &amp; grew. We continue to feel the effects of this trend today, over a century later.</p>

<p>Godin believes that we are now dealing with another catalyst of change, one that is even more powerful than the skyscraper: the community. Communities are growing in size and power. Companies that know how to leverage communities are thriving.</p>

<h3>Threadless is Not About T-Shirts</h3>

<p>Fast forward to the early 21st century where we find a Chicago-area company called Threadless. If you sell a product that is easily copied, how do you differentiate yourself from the competition? By selling something that goes beyond the easily cloned product. <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless</a> has created a community around T-shirt sales. When building the company, the founders of Threadless looked at available technology and asked themselves, “What do people really want?” Their answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be famous.</li>
<li>To be recognized.</li>
<li>To be talked about.</li>
</ul>


<p>So they built the company to fulfill these basic human needs. If you’re an artist, submit a design. If enough people vote for your design, it gets printed on a shirt. And while you’re looking around the Threadless site, you’re welcome to buy any of the other designs for about $20 each.</p>

<p>While other t-shirt companies are trying to undercut each other on price, Threadless gives customers what they really want, customers gladly pay a premium, and everybody wins.</p>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/rails_logo.jpg" width="200" height="285" align="right" title="Ruby on Rails Logo" alt="Ruby on Rails Logo"></p>

<h3>We Don’t Pay for Software. We Pay for Results</h3>

<p>Godin cites <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> as an example of a company that nutures a community of software developers by giving away software for free. 37signals extracted the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework from their Basecamp project management tool. Rather than charge for Rails, the company makes it available to the open source community at no charge. 37signals benefits because the people who use Rails, software developers, end up trying, buying and recommending the paid products to their colleagues. This results in an upward spiral in revenue for the company. To top it off, 37signals benefits from the open source community in ways that are not easily measured in dollars.</p>

<p>WisdomGroup is grateful to the entire Ruby on Rails community, including 37signals. We express our gratitude through <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> and <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>. Contributing to the open source community has enabled us to develop wonderful relationships with contractors, clients, advisors… all sorts of people who have helped us to grow &amp; prosper. User groups and conferences enable the software community to come together – creating something far beyond the grasp of an individual genius.</p>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>Seth Godin’s point: Our most successful companies are built around communities. Companies that know how to build &amp; nurture communities will thrive &amp; grow. Companies stuck in the old paradigm (massive advertising on a massive scale) might survive, but they will be easily eclipsed by companies that understand the value of strong communities. The revolution is here, and Seth Godin urges all of us not to waste it.</p>
