    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walking through Chicago’s <a href="http://msichicago.org">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, I ran across an inspiring list of rules titled &ldquo;Peter’s Laws&rdquo;. Peter Diamandis is Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation, best known for its $10 million Ansari X PRIZE for private spaceflight.</p>

<p>The Laws:</p>

<ol start="1">
<li>If anything can go wrong, Fix It!  (To hell with Murphy!)</li>
<!--more-->
<li>When given a choice-Take Both!</li>
<li>Multiple projects lead to multiple successes.</li>
<li>Start at the top then work your way up.</li>
<li>Do it by the book&#8230;.but be the author!</li>
<li>When forced to compromise, ask for more.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t beat them, join them, then beat them.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s worth doing, it&#8217;s got to be done right now.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t win, change the rules.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t change the rules, then ignore them.</li>
<li>Perfection is not optional.</li>
<li>When faced without a challenge, make one.</li>
<li>&#8220;No&#8221; simply means begin again at one level higher.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t walk when you can run.</li>
<li>Bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary.</li>
<li>When in doubt: THINK!</li>
<li>Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing.</li>
<li>The squeaky wheel gets replaced.</li>
<li>The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you
live.</li>
</ol>


<p>True, some of the &ldquo;Laws&rdquo; are over-the-top! My favorite from the list: #1. An excellent way to deal with obstacles.</p>

<blockquote><p>Things that get you fired when you’re young are the same things you win awards for when you’re old. You have to be courageous about your ideas. When you come up with something good, that means it’s different from what they expect so they’re likely to fire you. Years later (if you survive) they’ll bring it out as one of the great things that you did. <br/>~Francis Ford Coppola, Director<br/>&nbsp;The Godfather</p></blockquote>

<!--more-->


<h3>Quote Context</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/">Francis Ford Coppola</a> was reflecting on his experience as director of <em>The Godfather</em> when he spoke these words. When Coppola was selected to direct the picture, he was young and untested. He wanted to use the young, unknown Al Pacino for one of the major roles, Michael Corleone. The suits at Paramount wanted Coppola to fire Pacino. Coppola defied the suits and stuck with his first choice.</p>

<p>And today, film historians regard Coppola&rsquo;s decision as a genius move.</p>

<h3>Question for Today</h3>

<p>Where do we need to express courage right now?</p>

<p>Good is the enemy of great. If a company faces dire circumstances, managers must change because the alternative is death. But if circumstances are good (or even <em>okay</em>) managers can coast along indefinitely. A good company can be lulled into a state of complacency instead of achieving greatness.</p>

<p>So how does a good company become great?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Greatness Defined</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/good_to_great.jpg' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
A team led by author <a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/">Jim Collins</a> spent five years examining publicly traded companies to determine why some companies make the leap to greatness while others remain simply good. Collins and his team published their findings in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Social-Sectors-Monograph-ebook/dp/B0058DRTGC/">Good to Great</a>.</p>

<p>The study only focused on publicly traded companies since their financial data is readily available. The team defined great companies as those that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times (7x) over fifteen years. This is better than double the results delivered by some of the world’s greatest companies, including Intel, Coca-Cola, and General Electric.</p>

<p>Special attention was paid to companies that delivered average or poor results for fifteen years, followed by a sudden shift to great results. The team’s driving question: What are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? Or, in the diagram at the top of this article: What’s inside the black box?</p>

<h3>￼What Great Companies Do</h3>

<p>Collins and his team observed that great companies are great because of the way they think and act. This article will discuss two findings from the study:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Hedgehog Concept</li>
<li>The Stockdale Paradox</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Fox and the Hedgehog</h3>

<p>The hedgehog concept comes from an ancient fable about a fox and a hedgehog. The fox is hungry for a hedgehog dinner. Cunning and skillful, the fox has several clever attack plans to choose from.</p>

<p>The hedgehog is less clever. It has one (and only one) very effective plan: To roll itself into a ball, exposing its needles and forcing the fox to find food somewhere else.</p>

<p>The fox has many plans. The hedgehog has one plan. In the fable, simplicity triumphs over cleverness. The hedgehog wins.</p>

<h3>Hedgehogs and Business</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/hedgehog_concept.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
The Good to Great team discovered that great companies are like the hedgehog. Great companies focus on the one thing that they are good at. Further, great companies only fix their focus after an honest and serious examination of their strengths &amp; weaknesses. The best focal point lies at the intersection of three interlocking rings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Passion</strong>. What does the company feel deeply passionate about? What gives them that “I can’t believe I get paid to do this” feeling?</li>
<li><strong>Sound Economics</strong>. What will customers pay the company to do or provide? What drives the economic engine?</li>
<li><strong>Best in the World</strong>. What can the company do better than any other company in the world?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Deep Passion</h3>

<p>Gillette was cited as a great company where employees were excited about the advanced technology in their razors. They decided on advanced-technology razors largely because they couldn’t get excited about competing in the price-sensitive disposable market.</p>

<p>Employees of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) could never get excited about crunching numbers, but the idea of helping people buy homes proved exciting. Fannie Mae employees are on a heroic quest to democratize home ownership.</p>

<p>The Good to Great team observed that passion cannot be forced, it can only be discovered. Forcing your company to be passionate about an idea is like forcing yourself to like a particular flavor of ice cream. You either like it or you don’t.</p>

<h3>Sound Economics</h3>

<p>What will customers pay for? And what is the best way to measure progress toward greatness? The great companies found one metric (like profit per store or profit per employee) that every person in the company could focus on during the march to greatness.</p>

<p>One great company, Walgreens, chose profit per customer visit as the best economic measuring stick for their business. The decision was driven by their discovery that customers will pay for convenience, and the most convenient store locations are also the most expensive to lease &amp; maintain. The only way to justify expensive locations: Make every customer visit as profitable as possible.</p>

<h3>Best in the World</h3>

<p>Investor Warren Buffett says this about Wells Fargo: &ldquo;They stick with what they understand and let their abilities, not their egos, determine what they attempt.&rdquo; At one point the bank decided to shut down its international operations and focus on the Western United States. Other banks, notably Bank of America, pursued every possible opportunity regardless of its fit with their skill set. The result: Wells Fargo outperformed and outgrew the much larger competitor. Wells Fargo played hedgehog to the BofA fox.</p>

<h3>The Stockdale Paradox</h3>

<p>Admiral Jim Stockdale was the highest ranking U.S. military officer captured during the Vietnam War. During eight years of imprisonment, he and his fellow soldiers were tortured repeatedly and forced to participate in propaganda films as “well treated” prisoners. The prisoners had no idea whether they would survive to see their families again. Stockdale survived, and after his release, the Admiral and his wife co-authored an account of his ordeal in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-War-Familys-Sacrifice-Vietnam/dp/0060153180/">In Love and War</a>.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/stockdale_paradox.png' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span></p>

<h3>Optimism and Discouragement</h3>

<p>Imprisonment is far more serious than anything most business execs will ever face. Still, the Good to Great team and Admiral Stockdale were able to draw parallels between growing a company and surviving life as a POW. For example, the Admiral observed that optimists had the hardest time in prison. Optimistic prisoners always believed “we’ll be released next Christmas” only to be let down year after year. Many optimists eventually died heartbroken in prison.</p>

<p>Stockdale’s policy was to be brutally honest about the situation he was facing and to deal with it directly day to day. At the same time, he maintained faith that he would prevail in the end. During the pain of the ordeal, he decided to turn the experience into the defining event of his life. Thus the paradox: He brutally confronted his reality, yet he maintained faith that he would prevail in the end.</p>

<h3>Great Companies Respond Differently to Adversity</h3>

<p>Collins and his team observed that companies, being made up of people, behave like people. What separates the good from the great is not whether they have difficulties, but how they deal with those difficulties. Every company faces obstacles of one type or another. But the great companies face those obstacles directly, recognizing them for what they are, while at the same time maintaining faith that they will prevail.</p>

<h3>Stockdale Paradox Example</h3>

<p>The banking industry became commoditized during the 1980s period of deregulation. Some banks left the industry (voluntarily or otherwise). Wells Fargo, however, thrived and grew during the upheaval. They confronted the brutal reality of deregulation and commoditization by focusing on one region of the United States and moving more of their operations to small branches and ATMs. Result: Higher profit per employee. Other banks, that did not confront changing reality, were either dissolved or acquired.</p>

<h3>Does Technology Matter?</h3>

<p>What about technology? Great companies are not necessarily those that spent the most on technology. This makes sense when you consider that technology is only a tool; only a bus that a company chooses to ride. If the bus is headed in the wrong direction, a faster bus will only make things worse. But if the bus is headed in the right direction, then a faster bus might accelerate the move to greatness.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2015/05/20/muhammad-ali-and-the-hightower-brothers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/muhammad_ali_hightower_brothers.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Muhammad Ali and the Hightower Brothers, circa 1972.' title='Muhammad Ali and the Hightower Brothers, circa 1972.'><span class='caption-text'>Muhammad Ali and the Hightower Brothers, circa 1972.</span></span></p>

<p>These photos were taken in 1972 or &lsquo;73 with an old Polaroid camera. During a family road trip, my parents arranged a visit to <a href="http://muhammadali.com/">Muhammad Ali</a>’s training camp in Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. Dad was a big boxing fan. Mom&hellip; tolerated the three males in our household.</p>

<p>How fast was Ali in his prime? Very fast. One photo shows him evading a punch from my brother, Edward, who was about seven at the time. I distracted the Champ with a handshake. Hightowers always work together.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Our family didn’t receive any special treatment from the Champ. As I recall (through the eyes of my eight-year-old self) Ali interacted with everyone in the training camp that day. And I hear that he enjoys people just as much today.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to admire Ali. Among them are his discipline, courage, and effective marketing.</p>

<h3>Discipline</h3>

<blockquote><p>The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses, long before I dance under those lights.<br/>~Muhammad Ali</p></blockquote>

<p>A professional athlete cannot fake preparation. Sometimes the training feels endless. Road work, weights, sparring, and drills are designed to condition the mind and body for combat. Fakers are eliminated early; they never make it to the national stage. Champions have the discipline to train even when they don&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>

<p>Every profession has the equivalent of athletic training. For example, software developers are constantly reading blogs, experimenting with algorithms, and practicing kata. The best entrepreneurs are those who observe human behavior, and they build products and a team to meet customer needs. Sometimes the work feels endless. But champions do it anyway.</p>

<p>Champions, in athletics and in business, have the discipline to do what needs to be done even when they don&rsquo;t feel like doing it.</p>

<h3>Courage</h3>

<blockquote><p>I ain’t got no quarrel with those Vietcong.<br/>~Muhammad Ali</p></blockquote>

<p>Ali was stripped of his boxing title when he refused to fight in the Vietnam war. He was a conscientious objector. He was arrested and found guilty of draft evasion. Four years after the title was taken, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the conviction. Ali stuck with his values in spite of the professional cost. His view of the war in Vietnam was ahead of its time.</p>

<p>As professionals, how often are we asked to take a stand in the face of personal cost?</p>

<p>Ali currently suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. It would have been easy for him to lock himself in a room full of money and never interact with people again. However, he chose a different path. Through the <a href="http://www.thebarrow.org/Neurological_Services/Muhammad_Ali_Parkinson_Center/index.htm">Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center</a> he fights for a cure for himself and others. Ali continues to fight.</p>

<h3>Effective Marketing</h3>

<p>Ali talked trash before and after every fight, taunting his opponents with ridicule and poetry.</p>

<blockquote><p>Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.<br/>
The hands can’t hit what the eyes can’t see.<br/>~Muhammad Ali</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/ali_eth_2011.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Muhammad Ali with Edward Hightower in 2011.' title='Muhammad Ali with Edward Hightower in 2011.'><span class='caption-text'>Muhammad Ali with Edward Hightower in 2011.</span></span>
Ali’s boasting was all about marketing. My father used to say “people like to see a braggart get whupped.” The more Ali boasted, the more tickets the fight promoters could sell and the more Ali could justify big fees for boxing. Privately, Ali shared that he would never let his boasting interfere with his training.</p>

<p>In 2011, Ali and my brother met again at the <a href="https://alicenter.org/">Muhammad Ali Center</a> in Louisville, KY. Edward keeps copies of the 1972 photos on his phone; the Champ enjoyed seeing himself from long ago. Check out Ali’s t-shirt and the photos on the conference room walls. Ali is always marketing and he loves to interact with people. What a remarkable role model.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>We have this handy fusion reactor in the sky called the sun. We don’t have to do anything. It just works.
<br/>&nbsp;
~Elon Musk</p></blockquote>

<p>Elon Musk shared some interesting thoughts during the April 30th announcement for <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall">Tesla Energy</a>. Two charts stood out in particular.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Solar Panels Required</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/tesla_blue_square_energy.png' width='' height='' alt='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.' title='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.'><span class='caption-text'>From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.</span></span></p>

<p>Take a look at the map of the United States, above. A blue square has been drawn in the northwest corner of Texas. At map scale, solar panels with combined surface area equal to the blue square could meet all of the electricity needs of the USA. And we’re the most power hungry country on the planet!</p>

<h3>Batteries Required</h3>

<p>Solar panels are useless at night and on cloudy days. Fortunately, we can store excess energy on sunny days if we have the right kind of batteries. Tesla happens to make those batteries, hence the Tesla Energy announcement.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/tesla_batteries.png' width='' height='' alt='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.' title='From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.'><span class='caption-text'>From the Tesla Energy announcement on 30Apr2015.</span></span></p>

<p>The second map is drawn at a larger scale than the first one. For reference, the blue square covers the same surface area as before. At map scale, all of the batteries required to store reserve solar energy would fit inside the red dot.</p>

<p>What are we waiting for?</p>
