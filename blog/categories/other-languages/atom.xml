<h3>Why Rust?</h3>

<p>Rust is &hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Current Environment</h3>

<p>All of the steps in this article were performed on a MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite (10.10).</p>

<h3>Gotcha: Java 8 is Required</h3>

<p>I was greeted with a [let me install Java] dialog box during my Rust installation. Having no idea why this dialog box popped up, I hit <code>cancel</code> and the installation failed. A quick Google search showed me the error of my ways, so my second <code>Rust</code>  installation proceeded normally.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>==&gt; make</code> line seemed to execute for a long time (several minutes) during the installation, even after Java was installed. No indication of progress while make just sits there.</p>

<h3>Installation: Over 30 Minutes for Installation</h3>

<h3>Long Installation Time, No Feedback</h3>

<p>Something I haven‚Äôt seen written anywhere regarding Rust: Installation via Homebrew takes a long time with no indication that the command is making progress. The exact installation time on your machine may vary. For reference: I‚Äôm running a an early 2013 15‚Äù MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, and the installation took over 30 minutes.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew install rust
==> Downloading <a href="https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.12.0.tar.gz">https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.12.0.tar.gz</a>
Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/rust-0.12.0.tar.gz
==> ./configure &mdash;prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/rust/0.12.0 &mdash;enable-clang
==> make
==> make install
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/rust/0.12.0: 93 files, 196M, built in 33.7 minutes</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>To confirm a successful installation‚Ä¶</p>

<p>```bash
~$ which rustc
/usr/local/bin/rustc</p>

<p>~$ rustc &mdash;version
rustc 0.12.0-dev</p>

<p>~$
```</p>

<h1>Out-Takes</h1>

<p>Looks like Homebrew isn‚Äôt the best way to install Rust.</p>
