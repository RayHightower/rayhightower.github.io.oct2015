    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='/images/beaglebone-black-ubuntu-ruby-rails.jpg' width='' height='' alt='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.' title='BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.'><span class='caption-text'>BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, &amp; Rails.</span></span></p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu, Ruby, and Rails. Why Ubuntu? The Bone comes pre-installed with <a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/">Ångström</a>. Why not stick with Ångström?</p>

<p>My opinion: The factory standard is fine, but it&rsquo;s always good to have options. Here&rsquo;s why I decided to try Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu documentation is plentiful. Books, blogs, and videos are readily available.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu community is huge. When a dev runs into an Ubuntu-related snag, it&rsquo;s likely that another dev has encountered a similar problem, and they can collaborate on a solution.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the distro that I&rsquo;m most familiar with. <a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> uses Ubuntu for multiple projects. With a common operating system, knowledge gained in one environment is immediately useful in another.</li>
<li>Prepping for <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a>, the 64-core single-board computer that will cost about two hundred bucks. The Parallella is currently in short supply. When it becomes available, it will run Ubuntu. Experience with other single-board computers, especially those running Ubuntu, will prove useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>This article will show how to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone Black. <em>Gotchas</em> will be pointed out along the way. Where possible, I will explain the reasons behind my decisions so that you can make different choices if you like.</p>

<p>For a comparable examination of the Raspberry Pi, take a look at <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Ruby on Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<h3>Sudo Disclaimer: You Could Destroy Everything</h3>

<p>Procedures described here will ask you to use the <code>sudo</code> command. <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">Sudo endows users with great power</a>. You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using <code>sudo</code> incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date by the time you read this. Please be careful, and double-check these steps through your own sources.</p>

<h3>First Gotcha: Ubuntu 13 on the Bone</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Ubuntu 12 runs well on the BeagleBone Black, but Ubuntu 13 does not. My Ubuntu 13 installation appeared to be successful, but the Ubuntu 13 GUI hung up immediately after login. The Ubuntu 13 command line interface worked fine.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google reveals that others encountered similar roadblocks with version 13. One successful Bone/13 installation was used via SSH, not interactively via keyboard and GUI. Hopefully this will change with future updates. Or, since we&rsquo;re dealing in the open source world, maybe I can pitch in and help.</p>

<p>Due to the issues encountered with version 13, everything in this article will focus on Ubuntu 12.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Installing Ubuntu 12</h3>

<p>In addition to the BeagleBone Black, the following items should be gathered before installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro SD card of at least 8GB. It&rsquo;s possible to perform the installation with a 4GB card, but that won&rsquo;t leave much room for Ubuntu applications.</li>
<li>SD card reader/writer. Recent versions of Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro come with an SD reader/writer built in.</li>
<li>SD to Micro-SD card adapter. The Bone is designed for micro SD, and the MacBook Pro is designed for full-sized SD. Some micro SD packages come with the adapter.</li>
<li>A monitor that accepts HDMI input.</li>
<li>USB keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter. The Bone uses micro HDMI for video output, but your monitor probably uses full-sized HDMI.</li>
<li>External 5V power adapter for the Bone. Personally, I trust the standard 5v power input more than I trust the power provided via USB. One never knows if USB can provide sufficient (and stable) amperage for a circuit board. Power fluctuations can lead to strange behavior, including video flickering.</li>
<li>Ethernet cable with RJ-45 ends.</li>
<li>A fast internet connection.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Homebrew Required</h3>

<p>Homebrew is the easiest way to install &lsquo;nix utilities on Mac OS X. We need Homebrew in order to install some of the utilities needed to burn the SD card. The one-line Homebrew installation command is given on the  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew site</a>.</p>

<p>Each time we use Homebrew, we run <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> to make sure the packages are up-to-date.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run</code>brew update`.</p>

<p>$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from a2e44659 to 4c7bc9ec.</p>

<p>$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.
```</p>

<h3>The xz Extraction Utility</h3>

<p>Disk image files are downloaded in a compressed format. We need the <code>xz</code> utility in order to extract the files into something usable. If you already have Homebrew installed, this command will install <code>xz</code> for you.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ brew install xz
</code></p>

<h3>Test the BeagleBone Black First</h3>

<p>Power up your BeagleBone Black and make sure it runs with the built-in Ångström Linux installation. One great thing about the Bone is that it will <a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">boot to the Ångström GUI</a> straight out of the box, with no prior configuration.</p>

<p>If the GUI boots, then you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>If the GUI doesn&rsquo;t boot, it may have been damaged in a prior experiement. Embarassing note: I started looking for a way to install Ubuntu on the Bone because I broke my Ångström installation. What can I say&hellip; I learn more from destructive experiments. Faced with a non-booting Bone, I had two choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-build Ångström.</li>
<li>Try something different, like Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Option two worked well!</p>

<h3>Prep the SD Card</h3>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility is a convenient tool for wiping the SD card.  Standard warnings about any disk utility apply. Double-check everything, and make sure you&rsquo;re wiping the right volume, or you could lose all of your data.</p>

<p>Next, download the Ubuntu 12.04 image from <a href="http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/#precise">http://armhf.com</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the image using the <code>xz</code> utility.
<code>bash
$ xz ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz
</code></p>

<p>The extracted image will have a <code>.img</code> file extension. We will use the <code>dd</code> utility to burn the disk image to the SD card. But first, we need to determine the designation of the SD card.</p>

<h3>Find the SD Card Designation</h3>

<p>In order to burn the SD card, we need to make sure we target it correctly. Here&rsquo;s how to figure out which device to target.</p>

<p><code>$ diskutil list</code> will show all of the partitions mounted on the system.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk1
</code>
I happen to know that my SD Card is 8.0 GB in capacity, and my system also has a 500 GB SSD. The goal is to burn the SD card while leaving the 500 GB SSD (home of the Mac OS X operating system and all of my data) intact. From the <code>$ diskutil list</code> report, I can see that the SD card&rsquo;s designation <em>in my system</em> is <code>/dev/disk1</code>.</p>

<p>Note the italicized words <em>in my system</em>. Your system is probably different, especially if you have a DVD drive or a second hard drive. I have neither of those. The SD card&rsquo;s designation will be different in each system where it is mounted depending on the number and location of the drives that are already there.</p>

<p>Now that we know the SD card&rsquo;s designation, we can unmount it. We unmount the drive (but leave the card inserted in the reader) so that it can be written with the Ubuntu disk image.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful
</code></p>

<p>Looks like the SD card was unmounted successfully. Now we can write the
Ubuntu image with the <code>dd</code> utility.</p>

<h3>Writing the Ubuntu Image</h3>

<p>The following command will write the decompressed Ubuntu image to the SD
card.</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo dd bs=1m if=ubuntu-precise-12.04.3-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img of=/dev/disk1</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note that it may take up to an hour for the image to be written.</p>

<p>One drawback of using the command line is that there is no gauge to tell you how much progress the utility is making. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a way to measure progress at <a href="http://elinux.org">eLinux.org</a>. While the command line utility is running, and while that window has focus, type <code>control-T</code>. A few seconds later, the terminal window will show a brief activity report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a report from the first time I struck <code>control-T</code> &hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
load: 2.03  cmd: dd 75608 uninterruptible 0.00u 0.54s
40+0 records in
39+0 records out
</code></p>

<p>We can strike <code>control-T</code> again to receive additional updates. The numbers will tell us if we are making progress. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with <code>control-T</code>. A watched pot never boils :&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Booting with the New SD Card</h3>

<p>The terminal will return to the command prompt after the Ubuntu image has been written to the SD card. Now it&rsquo;s time to boot with the new image.</p>

<ol>
<li>Eject the SD card from the Mac.</li>
<li>Remove power from the BeagleBone Black, and insert the micro SD card.</li>
<li>Note the location of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; button on the Bone. It&rsquo;s the micro switch closest to the USB port. We will need to hold this switch down while powering up the Bone.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few notes about item #3. It takes some juggling to hold down a micro switch while plugging in power to the board. I found it easier to plug the power adapter into a powered-off surge suppressor, hold down the microswitch, and then power-on the surge suppressor with my elbow.  Sounds ridiculous, but it worked.</p>

<p>About sixty seconds after boot, the Linux penguin appeared in the upper left corner of the Bone display. And then the login prompt appeared.</p>

<p>Another note about the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; switch: It looks like the Bone will boot into the SD&rsquo;s operating system (instead of the eMMC flash OS where Angstrom resides) without the micro switch if the switch was used in the previous boot. I haven&rsquo;t rebooted enough times to test this thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Default Credentials for Ubuntu on BeagleBone Black</h3>

<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s default BeagleBone Black login credentials are shown here because I always end up hunting for these when I need them. It&rsquo;s much easier to have information at one&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>

<p><code>bash
login: ubuntu
pw: ubuntu
</code></p>

<h3>End of Part One</h3>

<p>This marks the end of part one of this post about BeagleBone Black and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Part two will cover Ruby on BeagleBone Black, including&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting the GUI running, including a disk resizing <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
<li>Installing Ruby, including a Ruby Version Manager (RVM) <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
<li>Installing Rails, and how to handle a JavaScript runtime <em>gotcha</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Stay tuned!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/arduino-youth-program.png' width='' height='' alt='Arduino' title='Arduino'><span class='caption-text'>Arduino</span></span>
Planet Earth is facing a shortage of people who make things. People like scientists, software developers, architects, and  engineers. People who use their brains and hands to make greatness happen.</p>

<p>To increase the world&rsquo;s supply of problem solvers, the organizers of <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> partnered with a group of energetic college students, the founders of <a href="http://hackthemonkey.com">Monkey Bars</a>. The result: Together, we launched the first WindyCityRails Youth Program featuring the Arduino microcontroller.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Video Summary</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the launch video:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/74022351" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The youth who participated in the program were engaged and enthusiastic. The Monkey Bars team introduced the youth to the Arduino micro-controller and related hardware.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, parents arrived to take their kids home, and the kids were reluctant to leave! They were absorbed in their Arduino projects. Even better, friendships formed between the youth participants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to think about the new companies that may have been launched that day!</p>

<h3>Next Year</h3>

<p>Planning for next year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails, including the Youth Program, is currently underway. If there are things you&rsquo;d like to see in next year&rsquo;s program, feel free to <a href="http://windycityrails.org/contact">contact the WindyCityRails organizers</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-22T22:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack.jpg" width="372" height="600" title="BeagleBone Black" alt="BeagleBone Black" align="right">
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a>, like the <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, is a small, inexpensive computer that runs Linux. It&rsquo;s smaller than a deck of cards and you can buy one for about forty-five dollars ($45.00). The device is made by <a href="http://circuitco.com">CircuitCo</a> in Richardson, TX, USA.</p>

<h3>It Just Works</h3>

<p>BeagleBone Black runs Linux right out of the box. Steps required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in the micro-HDMI cable for the monitor. See the &ldquo;Gotchas&rdquo;
section about micro-HDMI below.</li>
<li>Plug in the keyboard &amp; mouse via the USB port. You might need a USB hub because the board only has one USB port.</li>
<li>Add power via the mini-USB port or the 5v power connection.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a few minutes of boot time, we have a fully-functioning Linux computer with a GUI, Firefox browser, and other tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The BeagleBone Black has 2GB of flash storage on the board, and part
of that is used for Linux. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot after just a few minutes of ownership.</p>

<center><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-WindyCityRails.png" width="600" height="338" title="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" alt="BeagleBone Black Firefox WindyCityRails" align="center"></center>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/BeagleBoneBlack-USB.png" width="250" height="200" title="BeagleBone Black USB" alt="BeagleBone Black USB" align="right">
All of the paper documentation for the BeagleBone Black fits on a slip of paper roughly the size of two business cards. The meat of the documentation resides on the device itself. To reach the electronic documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the BeagleBone Black into a USB port on your laptop.</li>
<li>The board will appear as a USB storage device. One of the files at the
root of the storage device, <code>START.htm</code>, contains the documentation. It
can be viewed in a web browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The documentation recommends against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">MSIE</a>.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>

<p><img src="http://RayHightower.com/images/micro-HDMI-home-depot.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Micro HDMI Home Depot" alt="Micro HDMI Home Depot" align="right">
The manufacturer included a mini-USB cable with the device, so you can power it up right after you rip open the package. Gotcha: You need a micro-HDMI cable (or adapter) if you want to attach a monitor. I would have preferred a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapater in the box instead of the mini-USB cable. That&rsquo;s a little nit-picky on my part since micro-HDMI cables are easy to find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to Home Depot: Their store-brand cables let you test the cable end without opening the package, right in the store. Excellent package design by Home Depot.</p>

<p>My second &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; is more important: The <code>curl</code> command did not behave as flawlessly as it did with the Raspberry Pi, so I was not able to install Ruby as quickly as planned. Details below.</p>

<h3>Installing Rails</h3>

<p>I will have to cover Ruby and Rails installation in a future blog post because my initial attempts were not successful. <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">RVM, Ruby, and Rails installed easily with Raspberry Pi</a>, even though the compilation time was long. With the BeagleBone Black, I received the following in response to the <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<p>```bash
sh-4.2# curl -L <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable &mdash;ruby
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current</p>

<pre><code>                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
</code></pre>

<p>  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash;     0
curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)
sh-4.2#
```</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to try <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBEnv</a>? I&rsquo;ll post a solution when I find it. Or&hellip; if a reader of this blog already has a solution for the BeagleBone Black Rails installation challenge, please post in the comments below and I&rsquo;ll credit you here.</p>

<h4>BeagleBone Black vs. Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Which is better, BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi? There&rsquo;s no clear winner in my opinion. It&rsquo;s a matter of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone runs Linux right out of the box, while it takes some time to get Linux running on the Pi, unless you buy a card pre-configured for the Pi.</li>
<li>RVM, Ruby, and Rails installation was painless on the Pi even though compilation time was long. The jury is still out w/r/t RVM on the &lsquo;Bone.</li>
<li>Cost-wise, they&rsquo;re within ten bucks of each other. That&rsquo;s a wash.</li>
<li>The &lsquo;Bone has more Ardunio-like provisions for digital projects.</li>
<li>The Pi includes an RCA output for older TVs. Plus the Pi uses standard HDMI, so there&rsquo;s no need to get a special micro-HDMI cable.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve owned my &lsquo;Bone for just over 24 hours. Lots more to learn. Looking forward to it!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Upgrading Ruby With RVM]]></title>
    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-16T13:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rvm.io">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Ruby ecosystem.  Reason: RVM lets me experiment with Ruby and Rails at will. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my best experiments are full of risk so they eventually blow things up. When that happens, I can always recover the broken areas without wasting time on a full system restore.</p>

<p>Some devs choose to use another tool, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBenv</a>, that serves a purpose similar to RVM. I began working with RVM before the other tools existed, and since it has always worked well for me, I have no reason to switch.</p>

<h4>Ruby 2.0.0-p195</h4>

<p>The latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0, p195, was released two days ago. Time to take it for a spin. RVM lets devs upgrade Ruby and manage gemsets seamlessly. Here&rsquo;s how the process went.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Get the Latest RVM</h4>

<p>Instructions for installing RVM are at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.
If you already have RVM installed, you should confirm that you have the
latest version.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm get head
</code></p>

<h4>Grab the Ruby Patch</h4>

<p>With the latest RVM installed, you can upgrade to the latest Ruby
patch level.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm upgrade 2.0.0
Are you sure you wish to upgrade from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195? (Y/n): y
Installing new ruby ruby-2.0.0-p195
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
</code></p>

<p>The process took at least twenty minutes on my system. I don&rsquo;t have an exact time because I began working on other tasks during the upgrade, and when I looked back at the terminal window, the process was mostly complete, except for a few questions about gemsets&hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash
Migrating gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Are you sure you wish to MOVE gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195?
This will overwrite existing gems in ruby-2.0.0-p195 and remove them from ruby-2.0.0-p0 (Y/n): y
Moving gemsets...
</code>
&hellip;and aliases, wrappers, and archiving my patchless Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<p>```bash
Do you wish to move over aliases? (Y/n): y
Do you wish to move over wrappers? (Y/n): y
Do you also wish to completely remove ruby-2.0.0-p0 (inc. archive)? (Y/n): y
Removing ruby-2.0.0-p0&hellip;&hellip;..
Successfully migrated ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Upgrade complete!</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Upgrade complete. Now running the latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>As a final option, I chose to make this latest Ruby patch my default.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>~$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0 &mdash;default
Using /Users/rth/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>   macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86_64 ]

<p><a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">Ack</a> is an open source command line tool that lets developers search large trees of source code very quickly. If you are looking for a method definition in a haystack of files, Ack will find that needle for you. Many devs regard Ack as a replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>.</p>

<p>The Elmhurst <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> meetings are always a source of unexpected learning. Today ChicagoRuby welcomed <a href="http://twitter.com/petdance">Andy Lester</a>, creator of Ack. Andy released Ack 2.0 two days ago. He shared some of the latest features in an impromptu demo.</p>

<h4>Why Ack?</h4>

<p>Have you ever been working on a project, only to be interrupted when you need to look for something? It could be a method name, a variable declaration, or a string of text in a comment. A minor distraction costs you the time it takes to search plus the time required to re-focus.</p>

<p>All of us are more productive when we stay <em>in the zone</em>. Ack helps devs to maintain focus and thereby produce better results.</p>

<h4>First, Install Perl</h4>

<p>Ack requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> programming language. Perl comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and most Linux distros. If you&rsquo;re running on a &lsquo;nix platform, you probably have Perl already.</p>

<p>Windows installations are beyond the scope of this article. If you&rsquo;re running Windows, you might consider a Linux VM for Ruby and Rails-related work.</p>

<h4>Installing Ack on Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Installing Ack is so easy that it almost feels wrong: Grab Ack in a single Perl file and drop it in your <code>~/bin/</code> directory. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Ack can also be installed via <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, but I prefer the <em>drop it in ~/bin</em> installation since everything is contained in one file. Here&rsquo;s a more detailed version of the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have one already, create <code>~/bin/</code> as a subdirectory of your home directory.</li>
<li>Grab a the single-file copy of Ack from <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">http://beyondgrep.com/ </a></li>
<li>Drop the single-file copy of Ack into a file called <code>~/bin/ack</code></li>
<li>Make sure that <code>$HOME/bin:</code> appears at the beginning of your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ol>


<p>At this point you should be running Ack v2.0 or later. To verify:</p>

<p>```bash
~/bin$ ack &mdash;version
ack 2.02 (git commit f3c8827)
Running under Perl 5.12.4 at /usr/bin/perl</p>

<p>~/bin$
```</p>

<p>Installation complete. Now, let&rsquo;s take Ack for a spin.</p>

<h4>Using Ack at the Command Line</h4>

<p>For a sample project, let&rsquo;s use <code>demo_app</code> from Michael Hartl&rsquo;s <a href="http://rubyonrailstutorial.com">Ruby on
Rails Tutorial</a>. Imagine that you want
to find every file in the project that references <code>user_id</code>. How would
you do that?

<p>Fast, clear, and highlighted in color. Bonus: If you&rsquo;re a Vim user,
try <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">ack.vim</a> if you want to run Ack
without leaving your editor.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Ack helps devs to find things quicker without leaving the zone. Try it!</p>
