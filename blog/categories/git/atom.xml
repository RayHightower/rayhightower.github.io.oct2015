    <updated>2014-12-18T17:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/18/git-vulnerability-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> core team announced a security vulnerability and a corresponding fix. Hats off to the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> team (yes, Mercurial!) for finding the problem. Hats off to the <code>Git</code> team for making the announcement, and for delivering a fix so quickly.</p>

<h3>What’s the Problem?</h3>

<p>If your Git installation remains un-patched, then a malicious person could over-write the <code>.git/config</code> directory in one of your repositories. This would allow them to alter your Git history and make changes in the repo without your knowledge. <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1853266">Details</a>.</p>

<p>The vulnerability exists on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. This article will discuss solving the problem on Mac OS X only, since that is my primary development platform.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Mac and Windows users are exposed because their file systems are not case-sensitive by default. Linux users who use a case-sensitive file system are protected. But Linux users might want to apply the patch anyway because (as stated by the Git core team):</p>

<blockquote><p>Even though the issue may not affect Linux users, if you are a hosting service whose users may fetch from your service to Windows or Mac OS X machines, you are strongly encouraged to update to protect such users who use existing versions of Git.
~Git Core Team</p></blockquote>

<h3>Is My Machine Vulnerable?</h3>

<p>I know that my machine was vulnerable because I was running an un-patched version of Git, as seen below.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ git &mdash;version
git version 2.1.3</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a> makes it easy to install and maintain Git. First, update Homebrew&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from d243310d to a6ab9f13.
==> New Formulae
abi-compliance-checker        deis                     glbinding
asciinema             distribution                rbenv-bundle-exec
ctunnel                  game-music-emu           restund
==> Updated Formulae
abcm2ps                         jags
afl-fuzz                    jansson</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>Then, upgrade Git&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ brew upgrade git
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result:
git 2.2.1

<h6>################################################################## 100.0%</h6>

<p>==> Pouring git-2.2.1.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
The OS X keychain credential helper has been installed to:
  /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain</p>

<p>The &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; directory has been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib</p>

<p>Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d</p>

<p>zsh completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> Summary</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/Cellar/git/2.2.1: 1356 files, 31M
</code></pre>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>&hellip; and finally, verify that the patched version is in use.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ git &mdash;version
git version 2.2.1</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<h3>Avoid Conflicts With Apple&rsquo;s Git</h3>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/kcocev">Kristjan Cocev</a> notes in the comments below, Mac OS X comes with its own Git installation. By the time you bought the machine, that pre-installed version is probably out of date. My pre-installed Git was:</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ /usr/bin/git &mdash;version
git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git isn&rsquo;t bad, but here&rsquo;s the problem. Depending on how your <code>PATH</code> variable is setup, there might be a conflict between Apple-installed Git and the one you installed via Homebrew.</p>

<p>Here are two alternatives for fixing the conflict before it causes problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change your <code>PATH</code> variable so that Homebrew-installed Git is executed long before Apple-installed Git gets reached, OR&hellip;</li>
<li>Rename Apple-installed Git as follows:</li>
</ol>


<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ sudo mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git-apple
Password:</p>

<p>~$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>So now, if you want to use Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git (unlikely) you can simply navigate to <code>/usr/bin/git-apple</code>.</p>

<h3>Open Source Rocks</h3>

<p>Again, hats off to everyone in the open source community who pulled together to make this fix happen!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/31/github-page-build-warning-new-cdn/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-31T13:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/31/github-page-build-warning-new-cdn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>RayHightower.com</code> blog is built on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Recently, after I deployed a site update, GitHub emailed me a <code>Page build warning</code> message. Since this was <em>just a warning</em>, I ignored it while I attacked more pressing tasks (not always a good idea).</p>

<p>Today I finally took the time to research the topic so I could figure out what to do next. This article is the result of that research.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What the Message Means</h2>

<p>Here are the important points of the of the <code>Page build warning</code> message:</p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub introduced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery network (CDN)</a> for faster page loads and protection against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of sevice (DOS)</a> attacks.</li>
<li>If you do nothing to your GitHub Pages site, your pages will continue to load normally. People who visit your site will see no difference.</li>
<li>If you want the benefits of the CDN, follow the instructions given in GitHub&rsquo;s blog articles.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Original Message</h3>

<p>Here’s the original message. If you’re satisfied with the above translation, you can skip this section.</p>

<blockquote><p>The page build completed successfully, but returned the following warning:</p>

<p>GitHub Pages recently underwent some improvements (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages</a>) to make your site faster and more awesome, but we&rsquo;ve noticed that rayhightower.com isn&rsquo;t properly configured to take advantage of these new features. While your site will continue to work just fine, updating your domain&rsquo;s configuration offers some additional speed and performance benefits. Instructions on updating your site&rsquo;s IP address can be found at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,">https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,</a> and of course, you can always get in touch with a human at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#x40;&#x67;&#105;&#x74;&#x68;&#117;&#98;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#46;">&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#x74;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#46;</a> For the more technical minded folks who want to skip the help docs: your site&rsquo;s DNS records are pointed to a deprecated IP address.</p>

<h3>First: Check the CNAME File</h3>

<p>Since <code>RayHightower.com</code> was configured for Octopress a few years ago, it already had a <code>source/CNAME</code> file. To check the contents:</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash
$ cat source/CNAME
rayhightower.com</p>

<p>$</p>

<p><code>``
The</code>CNAME` file looks fine, according to the GitHub&rsquo;s blog. Time for the next step.</p>

<h3>Next: Domain Records</h3>

<p>The domain is registered with <a href="http://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a>, so the process was relatively quick.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into DNSimple&rsquo;s advanced editor for the domain.</li>
<li>Click <code>Add a Record</code> and select <code>ALIAS</code>.</li>
<li>Leave <code>Name</code> blank.</li>
<li>Next to <code>Alias for</code> enter the GitHub Pages endpoint. In my case, the endpoint is <code>rayhightower.github.io</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>More information on <a href="http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/github-pages/">GitHub Pages and DNSimple</a>.</p>

<p>I set TTL to 1 minute to encourage the changes to propagate quickly. If you know of a better configuration choice for TTL, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Expect Propagation Delays</h3>

<p>DNS changes can take up to a day to propagate. Delays tend to be shorter with DNSimple because time-to-live (TTL) can be set as low as one minute for some records. Updates will be posted here as I learn more.</p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p>If you’re on Mac OS X, make sure you’re using <a href="/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a>. It’s the easiest way to install and manage Unix libraries on the Mac.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to check your current version before upgrading.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash
$ git &mdash;version
git version 1.9.2</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>&#8220;`
Next, make sure that Homebrew is current.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash
$ brew doctor</p>

<p>Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>My Homebrew was outdated, so I used <code>brew update</code> to grab the new packages.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash
$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from b46160b8 to afff2b23.

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>Next, use Homebrew to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash
$ brew upgrade git

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/03/25/how-gitignore-works/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-25T18:20:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/03/25/how-gitignore-works</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I ran into a Git issue within a RubyMotion project. I added a directory to the project&rsquo;s <code>.gitignore</code> file, but Git seemed to ignore my ignore. Expressed more clearly, Git continued to track a directory that I explicitly told it to ignore.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Either there was a bug in Git, or my understanding of <code>.gitignore</code> was incomplete. It was time for me to dig in and learn more about <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What I Learned About .gitignore</h3>

<p>The root cause of my problem: Once Git has begun tracking a file or directory, adding it to <code>.gitignore</code> changes nothing. Git will continue to track the file unless we explicitly tell Git to stop tracking the file.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>$ git rm &mdash;cached [filename]</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>Or, if you want to stop tracking an entire directory (like me in this case)&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>$ git rm -r &mdash;cached [directoryname]</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>The <code>-r</code> flag will tell Git to stop tracking all of the sub-directories and files within <code>directoryname</code>, recursively.</p>

<p>Git was behaving exactly as designed.</p>

<h3>Penalty</h3>

<p>I should have known this a long time ago. My penalty: A public admission :&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/12/06/homebrew-ruby-and-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I encountered some interesting behavior between <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and Ruby this afternoon. I can describe what happened, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why. Perhaps another member of the dev community can shed some light.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Git 1.8.5</h3>

<p>Earlier today I learned that Git 1.8.5 was available. So I decided to upgrade. Since I use Homebrew for package management, it was time for <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>$ brew doctor
Error: Homebrew doesn&rsquo;t know what compiler versions ship with your version
of Xcode (5.0.2). Please <code>brew update</code> and if that doesn&rsquo;t help, file
an issue with the output of <code>brew --config</code>:
  <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues</a></p>

<p>Thanks!
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p><code>$ brew doctor</code> has spoken. Time to update Homebrew.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Homebrew First. Git Later.</h3>

<p>Updating Homebrew is as simple as <code>$ brew update</code>, right?</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ brew update
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/ant over mxcl/master/ant
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/cvs over mxcl/master/cvs
Error: undefined method `to_sym&#8217; for nil:NilClass
Please report this bug:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting
</code></pre>

<p>/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:123:in <code>report'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update.rb:121:in</code>each_line&#8217;

/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:95</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p><code>$ brew update</code> choked. Further, Homebrew said that I should report a bug. But something smelled fishy. I decided to try running Homebrew under Ruby 2.0.0 instead of Ruby 1.9.3, the default on my system. Running <a href="/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a> makes bouncing between Ruby versions a snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ rvm use 2.0.0</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>That did the trick. <code>$ brew update</code> worked fine, and <code>$ brew doctor</code>
confirmed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from 69a83176 to 691c72bf.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>~$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<h3>Back to Git</h3>

<p>Now that the yak is well-shaved, we&rsquo;re ready to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>~$ brew upgrade git

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m posting this article as a note to my future self. Error messages sometimes lie. They don&rsquo;t mean to lie, but an error messsage can only give you its best guess based on what it <em>thinks</em> is happening on your system. It&rsquo;s up to the developer to sniff out the rest of the clues.</p>

<p>After decades in this industry, I&rsquo;m still learning this lesson :&ndash;)</p>
