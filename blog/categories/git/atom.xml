    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/05/31/github-page-build-warning-new-cdn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>RayHightower.com</code> blog is built on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Recently, after I deployed a site update, GitHub emailed me a <code>Page build warning</code> message. Since this was <em>just a warning</em>, I ignored it while I attacked more pressing tasks (not always a good idea).</p>

<p>Today I finally took the time to research the topic so I could figure out what to do next. This article is the result of that research.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What the Message Means</h2>

<p>Here are the important points of the of the <code>Page build warning</code> message:</p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub introduced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery network (CDN)</a> for faster page loads and protection against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of sevice (DOS)</a> attacks.</li>
<li>If you do nothing to your GitHub Pages site, your pages will continue to load normally. People who visit your site will see no difference.</li>
<li>If you want the benefits of the CDN, follow the instructions given in GitHub&rsquo;s blog articles.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Original Message</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs the original message. If you‚Äôre satisfied with the above translation, you can skip this section.</p>

<blockquote><p>The page build completed successfully, but returned the following warning:</p>

<p>GitHub Pages recently underwent some improvements (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages</a>) to make your site faster and more awesome, but we&rsquo;ve noticed that rayhightower.com isn&rsquo;t properly configured to take advantage of these new features. While your site will continue to work just fine, updating your domain&rsquo;s configuration offers some additional speed and performance benefits. Instructions on updating your site&rsquo;s IP address can be found at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,">https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages#step-2-configure-dns-records,</a> and of course, you can always get in touch with a human at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#x69;&#116;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;">&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#98;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#46;</a> For the more technical minded folks who want to skip the help docs: your site&rsquo;s DNS records are pointed to a deprecated IP address.</p>

<h3>First: Check the CNAME File</h3>

<p>Since <code>RayHightower.com</code> was configured for Octopress a few years ago, it already had a <code>source/CNAME</code> file. To check the contents:</p>

<p>```bash
$ cat source/CNAME
rayhightower.com</p>

<p>$</p>

<p><code>``
The</code>CNAME` file looks fine, according to the GitHub&rsquo;s blog. Time for the next step.</p>

<h3>Next: Domain Records</h3>

<p>The domain is registered with <a href="http://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a>, so the process was relatively quick.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into DNSimple&rsquo;s advanced editor for the domain.</li>
<li>Click <code>Add a Record</code> and select <code>ALIAS</code>.</li>
<li>Leave <code>Name</code> blank.</li>
<li>Next to <code>Alias for</code> enter the GitHub Pages endpoint. In my case, the endpoint is <code>rayhightower.github.io</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>More information on <a href="http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/github-pages/">GitHub Pages and DNSimple</a>.</p>

<p>I set TTL to 1 minute to encourage the changes to propagate quickly. If you know of a better configuration choice for TTL, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Expect Propagation Delays</h3>

<p>DNS changes can take up to a day to propagate. Delays tend to be shorter with DNSimple because time-to-live (TTL) can be set as low as one minute for some records. Updates will be posted here as I learn more.</p>

Developers of Git are making a serious effort to improve intuitiveness for first-time users. Of course, all users benefit from intuitive tools. When our tools <em>just work</em>, we spend less time sifting through documentation and more time solving problems for our customers.</p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre on Mac OS X, make sure you‚Äôre using <a href="/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a>. It‚Äôs the easiest way to install and manage Unix libraries on the Mac.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs usually a good idea to check your current version before upgrading.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git &mdash;version
git version 1.9.2</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```
Next, make sure that Homebrew is current.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew doctor</p>

<p>Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>My Homebrew was outdated, so I used <code>brew update</code> to grab the new packages.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from b46160b8 to afff2b23.
==> New Formulae
aces_container                    git-number                      picolisp
apache-spark                    homebrew/versions/mongodb24       probatron4j</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next, use Homebrew to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew upgrade git
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result:
git 2.0.0

```</p>

<p>Finished. Let&rsquo;s check the Git version to confirm that the upgrade went properly.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git &mdash;version
git version 2.0.0</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Future articles will examine the this latest version of Git in detail. For now, enjoy!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/03/25/how-gitignore-works/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-25T18:20:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/03/25/how-gitignore-works</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I ran into a Git issue within a RubyMotion project. I added a directory to the project&rsquo;s <code>.gitignore</code> file, but Git seemed to ignore my ignore. Expressed more clearly, Git continued to track a directory that I explicitly told it to ignore.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Either there was a bug in Git, or my understanding of <code>.gitignore</code> was incomplete. It was time for me to dig in and learn more about <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What I Learned About .gitignore</h3>

<p>The root cause of my problem: Once Git has begun tracking a file or directory, adding it to <code>.gitignore</code> changes nothing. Git will continue to track the file unless we explicitly tell Git to stop tracking the file.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git rm &mdash;cached [filename]</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Or, if you want to stop tracking an entire directory (like me in this case)&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash
$ git rm -r &mdash;cached [directoryname]</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>The <code>-r</code> flag will tell Git to stop tracking all of the sub-directories and files within <code>directoryname</code>, recursively.</p>

<p>Git was behaving exactly as designed.</p>

<h3>Penalty</h3>

<p>I should have known this a long time ago. My penalty: A public admission :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I encountered some interesting behavior between <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and Ruby this afternoon. I can describe what happened, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why. Perhaps another member of the dev community can shed some light.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Git 1.8.5</h3>

<p>Earlier today I learned that Git 1.8.5 was available. So I decided to upgrade. Since I use Homebrew for package management, it was time for <code>$ brew doctor</code> and <code>$ brew update</code> as well.</p>

<p><code>``bash
$ brew doctor
Error: Homebrew doesn't know what compiler versions ship with your version
of Xcode (5.0.2). Please</code>brew update<code>and if that doesn't help, file
an issue with the output of</code>brew &mdash;config`:
  <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues</a></p>

<p>Thanks!
Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$
```</p>

<p><code>$ brew doctor</code> has spoken. Time to update Homebrew.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Homebrew First. Git Later.</h3>

<p>Updating Homebrew is as simple as <code>$ brew update</code>, right?</p>

<p><code>``bash
~$ brew update
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/ant over mxcl/master/ant
Warning: Could not tap homebrew/dupes/cvs over mxcl/master/cvs
Error: undefined method</code>to_sym' for nil:NilClass
Please report this bug:</p>

/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:95:in `send'
/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:95</p>

<p>~/Code/Ruby/apps$
<code>``
</code>$ brew update` choked. Further, Homebrew said that I should report a bug. But something smelled fishy. I decided to try running Homebrew under Ruby 2.0.0 instead of Ruby 1.9.3, the default on my system. Running <a href="/blog/2013/05/16/upgrading-ruby-with-rvm/">RVM</a> makes bouncing between Ruby versions a snap.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm use 2.0.0</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>That did the trick. <code>$ brew update</code> worked fine, and <code>$ brew doctor</code>
confirmed it.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from 69a83176 to 691c72bf.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>~$ brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Back to Git</h3>

<p>Now that the yak is well-shaved, we&rsquo;re ready to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ brew upgrade git
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result:
git 1.8.5.1
==> Upgrading git
==> Downloading <a href="https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/git-1.8.5.1.mountain_lion.bottle.tar.gz">https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/git-1.8.5.1.mountain_lion.bottle.tar.gz</a></p>

<h6>################################################################## 100.0%</h6>

  /usr/local/Cellar/git/1.8.5.1: 1333 files, 30M
```</p>

<p>Mission accomplished. Git has been upgraded to 1.8.5.</p>

<p>```bash
~$ git &mdash;version
git version 1.8.5.1</p>

<p>~$
```</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m posting this article as a note to my future self. Error messages sometimes lie. They don&rsquo;t mean to lie, but an error messsage can only give you its best guess based on what it <em>thinks</em> is happening on your system. It&rsquo;s up to the developer to sniff out the rest of the clues.</p>

<p>After decades in this industry, I&rsquo;m still learning this lesson :&ndash;)</p>
