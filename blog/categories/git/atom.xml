Developers of Git are making a serious effort to improve intuitiveness for first-time users. Of course, all users benefit from intuitive tools. When our tools <em>just work</em>, we spend less time sifting through documentation and more time solving problems for our customers.</p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre on Mac OS X, make sure you‚Äôre using <a href="/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a>. It‚Äôs the easiest way to install and manage Unix libraries on the Mac.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs usually a good idea to check your current version before upgrading.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git &mdash;version
git version 1.9.2</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```
Next, make sure that Homebrew is current.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew doctor</p>

<p>Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven&rsquo;t updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>My Homebrew was outdated, so I used <code>brew update</code> to grab the new packages.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from b46160b8 to afff2b23.
==> New Formulae
aces_container                    git-number                      picolisp
apache-spark                    homebrew/versions/mongodb24       probatron4j</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next, use Homebrew to upgrade Git.</p>

<p>```bash
$ brew upgrade git
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result:
git 2.0.0
==> Upgrading git
==> Downloading <a href="https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/git-2.0.0.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz">https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/git-2.0.0.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz</a></p>

<h6>################################################################## 100.0%</h6>

<p>==> Pouring git-2.0.0.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
The OS X keychain credential helper has been installed to:
  /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain</p>

<p>The &lsquo;contrib&rsquo; directory has been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib</p>

<p>Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d</p>

<p>zsh completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.0.0: 1324 files, 31M</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Finished. Let&rsquo;s check the Git version to confirm that the upgrade went properly.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git &mdash;version
git version 2.0.0</p>

<p>$</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Future articles will examine the this latest version of Git in detail. For now, enjoy!</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/03/25/how-gitignore-works</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I ran into a Git issue within a RubyMotion project. I added a directory to the project&rsquo;s <code>.gitignore</code> file, but Git seemed to ignore my ignore. Expressed more clearly, Git continued to track a directory that I explicitly told it to ignore.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Either there was a bug in Git, or my understanding of <code>.gitignore</code> was incomplete. It was time for me to dig in and learn more about <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What I Learned About .gitignore</h3>

<p>The root cause of my problem: Once Git has begun tracking a file or directory, adding it to <code>.gitignore</code> changes nothing. Git will continue to track the file unless we explicitly tell Git to stop tracking the file.</p>

<p>```bash
$ git rm &mdash;cached [filename]</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>Or, if you want to stop tracking an entire directory (like me in this case)&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash
$ git rm -r &mdash;cached [directoryname]</p>

<p>$
```</p>

<p>The <code>-r</code> flag will tell Git to stop tracking all of the sub-directories and files within <code>directoryname</code>, recursively.</p>

<p>Git was behaving exactly as designed.</p>

<h3>Penalty</h3>

<p>I should have known this a long time ago. My penalty: A public admission :&ndash;)</p>
