Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my <a href="/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> before I built a good tether management system. Bad idea! It&rsquo;s better to have a tether management plan (any plan) before you pilot your OpenROV.</p>

<p>This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have plans that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that fits you.</p>

<h3>The Tether Management Device</h3>

<p>This tether management system is constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts. The main component is an extension cord reel sold by <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/KAB-Enterprise-Co-Ltd-20-ft-16-3-Cord-Reel-with-4-Outlets-CR002/100661463?MERCH=RV-_-RV_homepage_rr-1-_-NA-_-100661463-_-N">Home Depot</a> for about $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and youâ€™re good to go.</p>

<h3>Slip Ring</h3>

The slip ring is central to this solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to spin while electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/736?gclid=CJDMiPma1cACFQoEaQod1iwAFQ">Adafruit</a> for about $18.00.</p>

<h3>Everything Fits</h3>

<p>The new tether management system is small enough to share space with an OpenROV inside a <a href="http://nanukcase.com/productdetails.asp?node=205">Nanuk 935 case</a>. The Nanuk case is rugged and small enough to fly as an airline carry-on.</p>

<p>Whip everything out and you&rsquo;re ready to explore.</p>

<a href="/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> #1227 went for a spin in Lake Michigan this week. Success! Here are a few first-voyage observations:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The electronics chassis is truly waterproof. Same for the battery compartments. Waterproofing was my biggest concern during assembly. Hats off to the OpenROV team for an excellent set of assembly instructions.</li>
<li>Condensation builds up in the electronics chassis during operation. A quick review of the OpenROV forum tells me that I should add a desiccant bag to the compartment. Or pack the unit in low humidity.</li>
<li>The OpenROV is a little back-heavy. The back dips lower than the front during operation. I should add some weights to the front of the unit.</li>
<li>Tether management is a <em>must</em>. After one voyage (can you really call a
simple dip in the lake a voyage?) my OpenROV tether is a mess. Time to
build a way to manage the tether.</li>
</ul>


<p>What an exciting way to explore Node.js, BeagleBone Black, and the Maker Movement all at once.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_esc.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.' title='Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.'><span class='caption-text'>Three ESCs, one for each motor. Each ESC has a switch and a power/signal connector.</span></span></p>

<h3>ESCs: New Experience for Me</h3>

<p>Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) were completely new to me when I first assembled my <a href="/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a>. This article documents my initial misunderstanding (and eventual understanding) of ESCs so that future builders can move forward with fewer glitches.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The photo at the top of this page shows an OpenROV controller board, a
BeagleBone Black, and three ESCs. This article will focus on the ESCs.</p>

<h3>Remember This About ESCs</h3>

<p>Until all three ESCs are programmed <em>and</em> calibrated, the OpenROV might behave erratically. For example&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>The servo that moves the camera up and down will not respond to keyboard commands.</li>
<li>When you turn one ESC switch on, an unrelated motor (or motors, plural) might start spinning. In my case, turning on one ESC (any of the three ESCs) caused two motors to spin.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my case, the programming was correct, but I <a href="/blog/2014/08/19/openrov-assembly-challenges/">dropped the ball on calibration</a>. And when the motors responded out-of-sync with the switches, I thought I had soldered some connections incorrectly. De-soldering and re-soldering connections would have been a ton of extra work, and that would not have solved the problem.</p>

<p>I reached out to the <a href="http://openrov.com/forum">forum</a> where OpenROV engineer Brian Adams pointed me in the right direction. Brian&rsquo;s diplomatic response could be summarized as <em>RTFM</em>. So I re-RTFM&rsquo;d, and it worked!</p>

<p>The bottom line: Do the ESC programming and calibration first. If the OpenROV misbehaves, re-check programming and calibration before considering other solutions.</p>

<h3>Why Use ESCs?</h3>

<p>Since ESCs require so many steps (programming and calibration) we might logically ask: <em>Why use ESCs at all?</em> Why not use simple analog motors without controllers and call it a day?</p>

<p>We use ESCs because the benefits outweigh the work required to configure them. It&rsquo;s all about control. By using an ESC to control each motor, we can use software to specify the <em>exact</em> number of RPMs and direction for each motor. We can make any motor (or combination or motors) start, stop, or change direction on a dime. Even better: When we move a lever on our controller of choice (keyboard, game controller, etc.) software on the OpenROV controller board decides the exact number of RPMs for each motor at that instant. OpenROV pilots don&rsquo;t need to think about this process while it happens. It just works.</p>

<p>The pilot&rsquo;s finger moves a controller lever. The lever position gets sent to software on the OpenROV controller board, and the controller board tells each ESC what its corresponding motor should do.</p>

<p>In summary, we use ESCs so that OpenROV pilots can have greater control over movement.</p>

<h3>How to Re-Check ESC Programming</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC program card.' title='ESC program card.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC program card.</span></span>
Those of you with ESC experience already know about ESC program cards. I first learned about the cards while researching this problem. Amazing devices! Yes, it is possible to program ESCs using the series of button pushes and beeps in the OpenROV instructions. That&rsquo;s what I did, and it works. But a program card is faster. Amazon sells ESC program cards for less than fifteen dollars each. Well worth the investment, especially if you&rsquo;re programming ESCs for several OpenROVs.</p>

<h3>ESC Calibration Gotcha</h3>

<p>ESC calibration was tricky for me because turning on any of the three ESC switches caused two of my motors to spin: vertical and port. Further, since my electronics chassis was (mostly) assembled by the time I got to the calibration step, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to trace each power switch to its corresponding ESC.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I had to do.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_esc_switch_labels.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC switch labels.' title='ESC switch labels.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC switch labels.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>First, I took everything apart, while keeping the electronic leads (those which had already been soldered) intact. I needed to do this so I could see where each wire was going.</li>
<li>Next, I labeled the back of each ESC switch with its corresponding ESC number. I did not want to go through the disassembly step again! The Brother P-Touch label maker was perfect for this step.</li>
<li>Finally, I followed the ESC calibration steps <em>while ignoring the behavior of the motors</em>. For example, turning on ESC1 caused the motors connected to ESC1 (port) <em>and</em> ESC2 (vertical) to spin. I ignored the motors while plowing through OpenROV&rsquo;s written calibration steps.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modified Calibration Steps</h3>

<p>Here are the OpenROV calibration steps, with slight tweaks based on my personal experience.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_calibration_sliders.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Click &ldquo;Diagnostics&rdquo; from the OpenROV cockpit.' title='Click &ldquo;Diagnostics&rdquo; from the OpenROV cockpit.'><span class='caption-text'>Click &ldquo;Diagnostics&rdquo; from the OpenROV cockpit.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Each ESC switch has a red reset button. To turn the ESC on, move its slider switch toward the red reset button. The off position is in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>With all of the ESCs switched off, go ahead and power up the OpenROV. The motors should remain stationary at this point. Connect with the cockpit software and open the diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>Grab one ESC switch, and hold down its red reset button while powering it on. (At this point, two of my motors began spinning, V and P. I ignored the spinning motors while plowing through the rest of the steps.) You will hear a beeping noise. Let go of the reset button. (It will keep beeping which is fine). While itâ€™s beeping, the red LED inside the corresponding ESC will flash in rhythm with the beeps.</li>
<li>Press reset once and you should hear a single beep. Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the right (or click the &ldquo;1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You should get 2 beeps. The motor will not move during this step.</li>
<li>Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the left (or click the &ldquo;-1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You will hear three beeps.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the motor will begin to spin. Switch off the ESC, and the motor will stop spinning.</li>
<li>Move the slider back to the middle (or click the &ldquo;0&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Repeat these steps with the next ESC until all three ESCs are done.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_lake_michigan_2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.' title='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.</span></span>
After calibration:</p>

<ul>
<li>With all three ESCs powered on, the motors remained stationary, as expected.</li>
<li>Each motor responded to the correct slider within the cockpit software&rsquo;s diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>The up/down servo for the camera responded correctly to the Q, A, and Z commands.</li>
<li>The motors responded to keyboard commands, as described within the cockpit&rsquo;s quick reference guide.</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, calibration worked when I ignored the behavior of the motors while plowing through the steps.</p>

<h3>Success</h3>

<p>There is great satisfaction in solving an elusive problem. The OpenROV forum proved to be a powerful and useful resource. Next step: <a href="/blog/2014/08/22/openrov-meets-chicago-lake-michigan/">Piloting the OpenROV in Lake Michigan</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_rth.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV fully assembled.' title='OpenROV fully assembled.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV fully assembled.</span></span>
I know this problem can be solved. I just havenâ€™t figured it out yet, and I need help from the <a href="http://openrov.com/">OpenROV</a> community to do so.</p>

<p><em>Update: The OpenROV community delivered. Solution: <a href="/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov/">ESC Programming and Calibration for OpenROV</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Parts That Work</h3>

<p>Software image updates on the Beaglebone Black work flawlessly thanks to scripts written by <a href="https://github.com/BrianAdams">Brian Adams</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codewithpassion">Dominick Fretz</a>. The cockpit software shows a real-time image from the camera, the LED lights are super-bright, and the lasers hold steady at 10cm apart. My fully assembled OpenROV passes the water submersion test. Yes, itâ€™s waterproof, thanks to O-rings and silicon-based lubricant!</p>

<p>What about the motors? The motors work, almost. Could it be the
electronic speed control (ESC) settings, calibration, or less than
perfect soldering? That&rsquo;s where I need help.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Summary of Symptoms</h3>

<p>With the cockpit software running and attached to the OpenROV:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I turn on any of the three ESCs, two of the motors (vertical and port) start running at full blast. The starboard motor remains stationary.</li>
<li>While the V and P motors continue to run at full blast, the starboard motor responds to the cockpit slider controls as expected: +1 makes S run full blast on one direction, -1 sends S full blast in the other direction, and 0 stops the S motor completely. During this exercise, V and P continue at full blast.</li>
<li>Turning off the ESC stops the V and P motors.</li>
<li>When I turn on any of the ESCs, the camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees. And then the V and P motors run full blast.</li>
</ul>


<p>When the cockpit software is not running (and the Google Chrome browser is completely closed):</p>

<ul>
<li>Turning on an ESC has no effect on the motors.</li>
<li>The camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees, as it did with the cockpit software running. But the motors remain stationary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Interesting behavior!</p>

<h3>Double-Checking the ESC Settings</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC Program Card' title='ESC Program Card'><span class='caption-text'>ESC Program Card</span></span>
During troubleshooting, my first step was to double-check the electronic speed controller (ESC) settings. Setting the ESCs with the beep-and-button-push method was time consuming. And I was concerned that I may have made a mistake in counting the beeps.</p>

<p>Solution: I bought an ESC program card. Amazon sells them for less than fifteen dollars, well worth the price when you consider the peace of mind that the card brings. The program card shows each ESC setting with a clear 7-segment LED display, much easier than counting beeps!</p>

<p>According to the program card, all of the ESC settings are correct.</p>

<h3>Using a Power Supply Instead of Batteries</h3>

<p>All of the time spent troubleshooting drained the OpenROV batteries. So I devised a way to apply power directly to the OpenROV without batteries.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/openrov_power_supply.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Directly connected to power supply.' title='Directly connected to power supply.'><span class='caption-text'>Directly connected to power supply.</span></span></p>

<p>The photo reveals the random condition of my work surface, so here&rsquo;s a verbal description of this hack:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the background, a power supply set to 12 volts</li>
<li><code>+</code> lead (red) connected to the <code>+</code> leads of the battery containers, via a wire acting as a Y-connector.</li>
<li><code>-</code> lead (black) connected to a ground terminal on the OpenROV controller board through a black jumper cable</li>
</ul>


<p>I find that this hack works best if I connect the 12 volt setup first while the Topside Adapter is powered off. Applying power (via USB) to the Topside Adapter turns the entire assembly on.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this section and you know a better way for me to connect the power supply, please advise in the comments section below.</p>

<h3>Advice Welcome</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to look next to solve the challenge with the motors. Maybe I skipped a step somewhere during assembly? Advice welcome!</p>
