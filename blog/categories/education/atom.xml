    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From a video interview with Steve Jobs:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little money.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.<!--more--></p>

<p>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people who are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build other things that other people can use.</p>

<p>Once you learn that, you&rsquo;ll never be the same again.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://madisonruby.com">Madison Ruby</a> 2013 was held this weekend. The conference attracts smart, intellectually curious people who are thirsty to learn more.</p>

<p>By the way, Madison Ruby was a lot of fun, too!</p>

<h3>Speakers: Impressive and Accessible</h3>

<p>First, lets cover the obvious high points so we can focus on those things that make Madison Ruby unique. Organizers <a href="https://twitter.com/jremsikjr">Jim</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/JenRemsik">Jen Remsik</a> have solidified their reputation for choosing engaging, well-prepared speakers. The Remsik network of speakers includes accomplished developers from around the world. Many are published authors. Some, like <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/">Danielle Lee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/marteeeen">Martin Atkins</a>, excel in fields outside of software development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What the presenters have in common: All are high achievers. All are inspiring. All take time to stick around after their time on stage to interact with attendees. That kind of interaction makes the Madison Ruby community work.</p>

<h3>Community in Madison</h3>

<p>Madison Ruby is unique in the way it brings the local community into the event. Local business and community leaders speak at the conference. The local leaders are enthusiastic about Madison and they engage attendees. One year, a farmer shared her experience growing up in a cheese-producing family business. This year, a biomedical engineering graduate of the University of Wisconsin encouraged the audience to build our creative muscles by having fun. She drove the point home with a hula-hoop demonstration, followed with a <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/classes/german-wheel/">German Wheel</a> performance by a colleague.</p>

<p>People from other worlds speaking at a software conference&hellip; it works.</p>

<h3>Meal Time</h3>

<p>Lunch was served by the entire Madison restaurant community. Gift certificates were supplied by Engine Yard, and the certificates were redeemable for meals at local restaurants.  What a wonderful way to put serendipity to work! Attendees who just met formed clusters of lunch parties on a whim. The conversations were rich.</p>

<h3>After-Hours Gatherings</h3>

<p>Thursday night&rsquo;s gathering, <a href="http://hypeharvest.com/">Hype Harvest</a>, had elements of a party but it was so much more. Hype Harvest was held on the roof of the Madison Museum of Modern Art, and it served multiple purposes. First, to raise funds for Nairobi Dev School, founded by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/tech/teenager-hacker-school-africa-google">Martha Chumo</a>, a 19-year-old software developer in Nairobi, Kenya. Second, to give everyone a taste of the presenters to come. Third, to let the attendees gather, renew old friendships, and begin new ones.</p>

<p>Friday night&rsquo;s party was held at <a href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>. An outdoor concert ran concurrently in the middle of the street next to the office. Bendyworks guests had the best seats around because the second floor office sits right above the musical stage.</p>

<h3>Madison Ruby and My Brother</h3>

<p>As an organizer of WindyCityRails, my relationship with Madison Ruby reminds me of my relationship with my brother, <a href="http://motoringventures.com">Edward Hightower</a>, while we were growing up. Edward and I are one year apart, and we competed aggressively in every way: On the swim team, in the <a href="http://troop534.org">Boy Scouts</a>, in academics&hellip; you name it. Through the competition, we learned to love and respect each other. My brother Edward is one of my closest friends. That doesn&rsquo;t always happen with family!</p>

<p>Madison Ruby competes with WindyCityRails. At the same time, I enjoy the trip to Madison because I get so much from the experience. Congratulations to the Madison Ruby organizer team for running a great event three years in a row. I plan to return next year.</p>

Age has little to do with ability. Every profession has examples of people who achieve goals even though others consider them <em>too young</em> or <em>too old</em>. People who excel in the face of stereotypes are exciting to watch.</p>

<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> listed some examples in a 1980s-era ad for United Technologies Corporation.</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s what you do &ndash; not when you do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ted Williams, at age 42, slammed a home run in his last official at bat.</li>
<li>Mickey Mantle, age 20, hit 23 home runs in his first full year in the major leagues.</li>
<li>Golda Meir was 71 when she became Prime Minister of Israel.</li>
<li>William Pitt II was 24 when he became Prime Minister of Great Britain.</li>
<li>George Bernard Shaw was 94 when one of his plays was first produced.</li>
<li>Mozart was just seven when his first composition was published.</li>
<li>Now, how about this? Benjamin Franklin was a newspaper columnist at 16, a framer of The United States Constitution at 81, and a scientist throughout his life.</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re never too young or too old if you&rsquo;ve got talent. Let&rsquo;s recognize that age has little to do with ability.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now&hellip; let&rsquo;s get back to work!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/07/19/petascale-tools-workshop-2013/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-19T02:12:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/07/19/petascale-tools-workshop-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.paradyn.org/CSCADS2013/index.html">Petascale Tools Workshop</a> is for computer scientists who create tools that enable apps to run efficiently on the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputers. Supercomputer performance is measured in petaflops: 10<sup><sup>15</sup></sup> floating point operations per second. That&rsquo;s blazing speed, thousands of times faster than the fastest MacBook Pro.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://WisdomGroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> was invited to attend the workshop because we have a client client, <a href="http://www.wisdomgroup.com/case-studies/texas-am-university/">Texas A &amp; M University</a>, operating in the high performance computing (HPC) space. As the only non-PhD in the room, I was given a chance to exercise Pat Metheny&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2013/07/17/pat-metheny-be-the-worst/">be-the-worst</a> philosophy in the extreme. The result: I learned things that will help WisdomGroup to deliver better solutions for our clients, especially the TAMU team.</p>

<h3>One Megawatt = $1,000,000.00</h3>

<p>As with other disciplines of engineering, supercomputer design is all about managing trade-offs. If you increase the clock speed, how will that affect your electrical bill? If you increase the size of the cache, how much more will you spend on hardware?</p>

<p>Every Petascale Workshop presenter highlighted the toughest constraint: The cost of electrical power. High performance computers gulp electricity. The wattage numbers were all very abstract to me until one presenter layed out a direct one-to-one correspondence between electricity and money. <em>One megawatt of power used over the course of a year costs one million dollars.</em></p>

<p>Express a constraint in terms of money, and the abstractions melt away.</p>

<p>The debate between the scientists was vigorous yet respectful. After hearing the 1-to-1 rule of thumb, one audience member remarked, &ldquo;I know how to genererate a megawatt for only $865,000.&rdquo; He then outlined his solution, a combination of coal, fossil fuels, and natural gas that would achieve the reduction. The more important point: Electricity is expensive.</p>

<h3>Re-Framing the Power Problem</h3>

<p>There is another way to look at the power problem. Consider it from the perspective of performance, not power. Here&rsquo;s how one presenter put it: No matter where we build a supercomputer, we will only have a limited amount of power. Let&rsquo;s look at the maximum available power as a constraint and go from there.</p>

<p>Rubyists are familiar with the saying &#34;<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php">constraints are liberating</a>&#34;, popularized by 37signals. Since power limitations are real constraints, our next step is to figure out how to extract the best results allowed within the constraints.</p>

<h3>Top Five</h3>

<p>Supercomputer scientists are as competitive as olympic athletes. As of June 2013, the five fastest machines in the world are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br/>
Scientists determine Rmax by running the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a> benchmark. <a href="http://top500.org">Top500.org</a> has more information about the fastest
machines.</p>

<h3>Digging Deeper</h3>

<p>Some of the biggest performance gains can be realized through more efficient software. Most supercomputers run some distribution of Linux. Some teams of researchers focus on ways to optimize the Linux kernel for supercomputing.</p>

<p>Optimization is not a one-size-fits all process. The scientists need to consder the type of applications being run, percentage of time spent on I/O, efficiency of algorithms, and so on. Each potential optimization choice is like a node on an ever expanding tree. The choices are endless, and the seasoned expert will know where to focus for the best results.</p>

<p>In the Ruby world, we might use tools like <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> or <a href="http://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> to identify hot spots in our code, places where re-factoring can reduce CPU utilization or improve I/O. HPC tools tend to be highly customizable because the users are intimately familar with their own hardware. During a lunch conversation, one team of scientists shared how they suspected a defect in hardware counters used to measure the behavior of a supercomputer under study. The instincts of the scientists proved correct, and the errant counters were replaced.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When smart people challenge each other to grow, great things happen. The scientists at the Petascale Tools Workshop were clearly helping each other to grow. The next few years in supercomputing will be exciting!</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I am grateful to the organizers of the Petascale Tools Workshop for hosting the event, and to the TAMU team for extending the invitation. Thank you both!</p>
