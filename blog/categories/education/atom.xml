The biggest challenge for a software developer: Absorbing the latest knowledge while simultaneously keeping clients happy. Where does the time go?</p>




<p>Fortunately, when it comes to HTML5 and CSS3, a UK-based publisher has released a just-the-facts guide that may help. At 127 pages, the entire publication (they call it a <em>bookazine</em>) can be devoured in a single day. Imagine Publishing&rsquo;s <em>HTML5 &amp; CSS3: The Complete Manual</em> is well worth the time investment.</p>




<p><em>Note: A version of this article also appears in the <a href="http://www.chicagoruby.org/book-reviews/archives/2015/03/06/html5-css3-the-complete-manual/">Book Reviews section of ChicagoRuby.org</a></em>.</p>

<h3>This Book&rsquo;s Best Feature</h3>




<p>One thing I like about this book: Nothing is assumed. All explanations are clearly presented from square one. The introduction even defines the terms <em>hypertext</em> and <em>responsive design</em> in words that could easily be hijacked for your next presentation to non-technical management.</p>




<p>Personally, I appreciate the don&rsquo;t-assume-anything definitions. I completed all of my formal computer science training in the last century, before we knew how far this Internet thing might go. Books like this help to fill in the gaps. Well done, authors!</p>




<h3>Working the Examples</h3>




<p>If you’re already current on HTML &amp; CSS, the examples in the beginning of the book will be too easy for you. Skip ahead to the examples toward the end and work on those. The sections on responsive design, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> are especially useful.</p>




<h3>Spelling Differences</h3>




<p>My British-speaking friends and I sometimes tease each other about variations in American vs UK spelling for certain words. &ldquo;Colour&rdquo; vs &ldquo;color&rdquo; and that sort of thing. This book uses UK conventions.</p>




<p>I spotted a fair number of typos in the book&rsquo;s code examples. Typos in human-readable text are no big deal. But a missing <code>&gt;</code> or <code>=</code> in a book about HTML and CSS can make or break an example. Of course, we’re all human and typos are simply a fact of life.</p>




<p>Suggestion for the publishers: Setup a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> repo with the code samples. That way, if typos in code are discovered (always certain because we&rsquo;re human) the typos can be corrected and shared immediately.</p>




<h3>Conclusion</h3>




<p>The bottom line: <em>HTML5 &amp; CSS3: The Complete Manual</em> is worth reading, especially if you need a quick way to keep up with web trends.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing&hellip; What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.&rdquo;
<br/>&nbsp;
~ Alan J. Perlis,
from the Dedication page in SICP</p></blockquote>




<p>Enrolling in the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296">Chicago SICP study group</a>, I expected to dive into Lisp. I expected to be challenged. What I didn’t expect: The fun, somewhat irreverent attitude of the SICP authors. And why not? Software development is one of our newest professions. Other professionals are made more effective through our work. Everybody benefits from the increase in productivity.</p>

<p>If you are a software developer in the Chicago area, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296">the SICP group</a>. As the SICP authors say, you don’t need to know Lisp to embark on this path; you’ll learn Lisp as we travel along. And our brains will be stretched in new and interesting ways.</p>




<p>What an exciting time to be alive!</p>

<h3>Installing Scheme on Mac OS X</h3>




<p>Examples and exercises in SICP are written in Scheme, a dialect of the LISP programming language. As of this writing, installing <code>mit-scheme</code> via Homebrew <em>did not work for me</em>.</p>




<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>brew install mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>Error: No available formula <span class="k">for </span>mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>Searching formulae...
</span><span class='line'>Searching taps...
</span><span class='line'>homebrew/x11/mit-scheme
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>




<p><em>Update: Some members of the SICP study group had success installing <code>mit-scheme</code> with Homebrew, while others (like me) did not. We did not determine why some of the Homebrew installations were successful. However, the non-Homebrew method described in this article seems to work across-the-board.</em></p>




<p>Alternative solution: Grab a pre-compiled binary from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">MIT/GNU Scheme</a> site. The <code>mit-scheme-9.2-x86-64.dmg</code> disk image was the right one for my early 2013 MacBook Pro. Your system may be different.</p>




<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/gnu_float.png' width='' height='' alt='Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.' title='Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.'><span class='caption-text'>Opening the MIT/GNU Scheme disk image.</span></span></p>




<p>To install, drag the <code>MIT/GNU Scheme.app</code> icon into the Applications folder on the Mac.</p>




<h3>Setting Up Symlinks</h3>




<p>Scheme is run from the command line. In order to make that work, we need to setup two symbolic links.</p>




<p>First, create a symbolic link called <code>mit-scheme-x86-64</code> in your home directory that links to the appropriate executable in the <code>/Applications</code> directory. In other words&hellip;</p>




<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /Applications/MIT<span class="se">\:</span>GNU<span class="se">\ </span>Scheme.app/Contents/Resources /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>




<p>Next, setup a symlink that will let us simply type <code>scheme</code> when we want to use this version of the language&hellip;</p>




<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64/mit-scheme /usr/bin/scheme
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>




<p>Confirm that the links are in place by checking the <code>scheme</code> version number.</p>




<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you are like me, you will laugh at the gladiator message at the end of the version info.</p>




<h3>Better Way to Symlink?</h3>




<p>Why not create a single symbolic link directly from the <code>Resources</code> directory to the <code>scheme</code> command in <code>/usr/bin</code>? I am not certain, but I suspect it has something to do with expectations within the Scheme interpreter. The interpreter may be expecting certain files to be in certain directories. I’ll update this article when I learn more.</p>




<h3>Running Scheme</h3>




<p>To start the Scheme read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL)&hellip;</p>

Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?</p>




<ul>
<li><p>You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you&rsquo;re &ldquo;done&rdquo;, you know you can make it better, but you&rsquo;re not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.</p></li>
<li><p>You recently graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://thestarterleague.com">Starter League</a>, <a href="http://www.mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers</a> or another school. You&rsquo;re ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.</p></li>
<li><p>You are no longer a beginner. You have seen <em>advanced</em> developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Software development is relatively new to you, and you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can launch something useful.</p></li>
</ul>




<p>Common thread: It&rsquo;s time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle <em>Big League Problems</em>. <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> is for you.</p>




<!--more-->




<h3>What are Big League Problems?</h3>




<p>You might think of a big league problem as a good problem. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you&rsquo;re bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would buy from you?</p>




<p>Now&hellip; How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecture, choose a new platform, or some combination of these? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#williams">Dr. Nic Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#shirai">Brian Shirai</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#light">Evan Light</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#menard">Mark Menard</a> deal with scaling problems. Learn from them.</p>




<p>Maybe you built a gem to solve a problem for yourself, and now you want to release your gem to the world. What legal questions do you need to consider? Did Rails face similar challenges in the beginning? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#saper">Daliah Saper</a> is an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and other open source software issues. Put her team to work for you.</p>




<p>How about security? Have you outgrown the <code>Devise</code> gem? Or do you simply need to know more about <code>Devise</code> internals so that you can use it more effectively? Maybe it&rsquo;s time to abandon username/password logins altogether and go with SQRL. <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#love">Justin Love</a> and <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#mazza">Lucas Mazza</a> might have some ideas for you.</p>




<h3>Awesome Speakers. Awesome Audience.</h3>




<p>This year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails features the most powerful collection of speakers we&rsquo;ve ever assembled. Check out the <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/">complete list of WindyCityRails speakers</a> and ask yourself what you can learn from each one.</p>




<p>Even better: Only 300 WindyCityRails tickets will be sold. Our speakers enjoy interacting with audience members throughout the conference. As professionals, they are always learning, too! So if you want some face time with people who understand Big League Problems (and more importantly, Big League Solutions) WindyCityRails is the place for you to be.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>You know what the trouble is? We used to make things in this country, build things. Now we just put our hand in the next guy’s pocket.
<br/>~Frank Sobatka</p></blockquote>




<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/zero-to-maker.gif' width='' height='' alt='' title=''><span class='caption-text'></span></span>
David Lang is a maker. After a stint with a struggling Silicon Valley startup, David teamed up with former NASA engineer <a href="http://openrov.com/profile/1gupl83kvnk8f">Eric Stackpole</a> to build an underwater robot called <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a>. That&rsquo;s a two-sentence oversimplification of David&rsquo;s maker journey, detailed in his book: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028284.do">Zero to Maker: Learn (Just Enough) to Make (Just About) Anything</a>.</p>




<p>The book starts off like a novel, with the exploration of the mysterious Hall City Cave and an 1840s-era gold robbery. Fast-forward to the present day where a multi-disciplinary team of makers joins forces to create an inexpensive vehicle for underwater exploration.</p>




<p>The author was not a born maker. But through force of will, discipline, and the right mentorship, he grew from non-maker to co-founder of the OpenROV company in roughly one year.</p>




<!--more-->




<h3>Making is a Team Sport</h3>




<p><em>Zero to Maker</em> will not teach you how to use tools, what to make, or what manuals to read. But it will put you on the path to learning. For example, the author shares his first experience at a <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a>, a gathering for people who make things. Many of the exhibitors have spent decades honing their skills, while some are brand new and full of enthusiasm. Everyone shares knowledge in the Maker community. And as a result, everyone grows.</p>




<p>Maker Spaces are places where tools and expertise are shared on a regular basis. <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> is a maker space in San Francisco where the author got some of his early experience with specialized tools. <a href="http://pumpingstationone.org/">Pumping Station One</a> and <a href="http://www.sshchicago.org/">Southside Hackerspace Chicago</a> shoot for similar goals in Chicago.</p>




<p>The author points out that no matter what you&rsquo;re trying to make, chances are that someone else has made something similar and they can share experience with you. Likewise, you have experience that other makers may find valuable, even on day one of your maker journey. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t know what we know. Maker communities remove the friction so that knowledge can be shared more freely.</p>




<h3>The IKEA Effect</h3>




<p>Why is the maker movement so powerful? The author explores this question in one very interesting section of the book. As it turns out, Researchers at the Harvard Business School think they have the answer. When we put our sweat and effort into building a project, we perceive the project to be more valuable. The researchers refer to this phenomenon as the IKEA effect. If we sweat to build something, it becomes valuable to us.</p>




<h3>Recommendation</h3>




<p>If you are a maker, or if you want to become a maker, this book is worth reading. And once you&rsquo;re done reading, go make something!</p>
