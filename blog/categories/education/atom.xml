    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/parallella-portable.png' width='' height='' alt='Portable Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, &amp; Parallella.' title='Portable Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, &amp; Parallella.'><span class='caption-text'>Portable Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, &amp; Parallella.</span></span>
<a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a> are three examples of small, powerful Linux-based computers. But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.</p>

<h3>Inspiration in a Suitcase</h3>

<p>The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my <em>regular work</em> faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent time learning assembler with the HP 5036.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/hp-5036.png' width='' height='' alt='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab' title='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab'><span class='caption-text'>HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab</span></span></p>

<p>The entire 5036 fits in a suitcase&hellip; how cool is that! Here&rsquo;s how the 5036 works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing assembler-level code by hand on paper.</li>
<li>Grab the reference book for the microprocessor running on the
board, Intel 8080.</li>
<li>For each assembler-level command, find the corresponding 2-digit
hexidecimal operation code.</li>
<li>Key the op code into the 5036 by hand.</li>
<li>Run the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Working with the 5036 was addictive in a positive way. In a subsequent job, where I wrote assembler to drive hardware devices, I was ready.</p>

<h3>Portability Needed</h3>

<p>Fast forward a few decades. We now have the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella. Wonderful devices with one flaw in common: No portability. That&rsquo;s when I had a flashback to my days with the 5036.</p>

<p>I bought a $35 technician box from Home Depot and I ripped out the insides. Micro Center had 720p LCD monitors on sale for $90, so I bought one of those. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the extra bucks for a 1080p LCD because you never know how something like this might work out! Finally, I topped everything off with a $25 keyboard/trackpad combo from Amazon.  The result appears in the photo at the top of this article.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why did I spend the time and money to assemble this kit? It&rsquo;s all about learning. Devs learn more when we interact with other devs &ndash; people who are learning some of the same things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with. And sometimes the things we need to learn are too new for books.</p>

<p>By carrying my Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella with me in a portable unit, I can share my experiences with other devs and learn more in the process. Everybody wins when that happens.</p>

<h3>Thanks SCNA!</h3>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA)</a> gave me the opportunity to present this story as a lightning talk at the conference. Slides are here:</p>

<p>Thank you SCNA! As I shared with the other devs at SCNA, I will gladly post my mistakes and <em>gotchas</em> here for people who want to build a unit like this. Let&rsquo;s build!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/10/31/tohtml-using-vim-code-snippets-in-keynote-presentations/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-31T16:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/10/31/tohtml-using-vim-code-snippets-in-keynote-presentations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While finishing my presentation for the upcoming <a href="http://chippewavalleycodecamp.com/">Chippewa Valley Code Camp</a>, I decided to add some blocks of code to my slides. I forgot the name of the tool I used for my last slide deck, and it took several minutes of Google-fu to find it.</p>

<p>Google led me back to <code>:TOhtml</code>. Whew! I&rsquo;m documenting <code>:TOhtml</code> here to avoid wasting time with a future search.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Start With a Block of Code</h3>

<p>Fire up Vim and drop the block of code you want to convert into a new Vim buffer. In this example, I&rsquo;ve created a sample <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> OS X app, and I want to show the contents of the Rakefile.</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>&ndash;<em>&ndash; coding: utf-8 &ndash;</em>&ndash;</h1>

<p>$:.unshift(&ldquo;/Library/RubyMotion/lib&rdquo;)
require &lsquo;motion/project/template/osx&rsquo;</p>

<p>begin
  require &lsquo;bundler&rsquo;
  Bundler.require
rescue LoadError
end</p>

<p>Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # Use `rake config' to see complete project settings.
  app.name = &lsquo;EjectDisks&rsquo;
  app.info_plist[&lsquo;LSUIElement&rsquo;] = true
end
```</p>

<p>(Acknowledgement: I&rsquo;m using the <code>osx-status-bar-app-template</code> gem by <a href="http://ejdraper.com/">Elliott Draper</a> for this example.)</p>

<p>Next, visually select the lines you want to convert. You can do this with shift-V, or with the (gasp!) mouse. Or if you want to convert the entire file,</p>

<p>Enter <code>:TOhtml</code> in the command area. Vim will convert the highlighted text into HTML in a new buffer. Here&rsquo;s the result:</p>

<p>```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &ldquo;&ndash;//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd</a>&rdquo;>

<script type='text/javascript'>
<!--

/* function to open any folds containing a jumped-to line before jumping to it */
function JumpToLine()
{
  var lineNum;
  lineNum = window.location.hash;
  lineNum = lineNum.substr(1); /* strip off '#' */

  if (lineNum.indexOf('L') == -1) {
    lineNum = 'L'+lineNum;
  }
  lineElem = document.getElementById(lineNum);
  /* Always jump to new location even if the line was hidden inside a fold, or
   * we corrected the raw number to a line ID.
   */
  if (lineElem) {
    lineElem.scrollIntoView(true);
  }
  return true;
}
if ('onhashchange' in window) {
  window.onhashchange = JumpToLine;
}

</pre>


<p></body>
</html></p>

<!-- vim: set foldmethod=manual : -->


<p>```</p>

<p>Save the new buffer as <code>~/Desktop/convertedstuff.html</code> or any other file name that you choose. In this case, I chose:</p>

<p><code>
:w ~/Desktop/convertedrakefile.html
</code></p>

<p>Open the converted file in a web browser.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/rakefile-browser.png' width='' height='' alt='Rakefile in Chrome.' title='Rakefile in Chrome.'><span class='caption-text'>Rakefile in Chrome.</span></span></p>

<p>Copy and paste the text from the browser into Keynote.</p>

<h3>Washed Out Code?</h3>

<p>If the code looks washed out when you paste it into Keynote, you have a few alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a different theme in Vim at the beginning, or</li>
<li>Darken/lighten the background in Keynote by using the Keynote inspector.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Finished Slide</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the finished product looks like. All the clarity of syntax-highlighted text. You can even adjust font size at will using the Keynote inspector. All set for the presentation.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/osxfinished.png' width='' height='' alt='The final snippet, in Keynote.' title='The final snippet, in Keynote.'><span class='caption-text'>The final snippet, in Keynote.</span></span></p>

<h3>Easier Way?</h3>

<p>Can this process be simplified? If you know the answer, feel free to mention it in the comments below. Thanks!</p>

Planet Earth is facing a shortage of people who make things. People like scientists, software developers, architects, and  engineers. People who use their brains and hands to make greatness happen.</p>

<p>To increase the world&rsquo;s supply of problem solvers, the organizers of <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> partnered with a group of energetic college students, the founders of <a href="http://hackthemonkey.com">Monkey Bars</a>. The result: Together, we launched the first WindyCityRails Youth Program featuring the Arduino microcontroller.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Video Summary</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the launch video:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/74022351" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The youth who participated in the program were engaged and enthusiastic. The Monkey Bars team introduced the youth to the Arduino micro-controller and related hardware.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, parents arrived to take their kids home, and the kids were reluctant to leave! They were absorbed in their Arduino projects. Even better, friendships formed between the youth participants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to think about the new companies that may have been launched that day!</p>

<h3>Next Year</h3>

<p>Planning for next year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails, including the Youth Program, is currently underway. If there are things you&rsquo;d like to see in next year&rsquo;s program, feel free to <a href="http://windycityrails.org/contact">contact the WindyCityRails organizers</a>.</p>

<a href="http://madisonruby.com">Madison Ruby</a> 2013 was held this weekend. The conference attracts smart, intellectually curious people who are thirsty to learn more.</p>

<p>By the way, Madison Ruby was a lot of fun, too!</p>

<h3>Speakers: Impressive and Accessible</h3>

<p>First, lets cover the obvious high points so we can focus on those things that make Madison Ruby unique. Organizers <a href="https://twitter.com/jremsikjr">Jim</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/JenRemsik">Jen Remsik</a> have solidified their reputation for choosing engaging, well-prepared speakers. The Remsik network of speakers includes accomplished developers from around the world. Many are published authors. Some, like <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/">Danielle Lee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/marteeeen">Martin Atkins</a>, excel in fields outside of software development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What the presenters have in common: All are high achievers. All are inspiring. All take time to stick around after their time on stage to interact with attendees. That kind of interaction makes the Madison Ruby community work.</p>

<h3>Community in Madison</h3>

<p>Madison Ruby is unique in the way it brings the local community into the event. Local business and community leaders speak at the conference. The local leaders are enthusiastic about Madison and they engage attendees. One year, a farmer shared her experience growing up in a cheese-producing family business. This year, a biomedical engineering graduate of the University of Wisconsin encouraged the audience to build our creative muscles by having fun. She drove the point home with a hula-hoop demonstration, followed with a <a href="http://madisoncircusspace.com/classes/german-wheel/">German Wheel</a> performance by a colleague.</p>

<p>People from other worlds speaking at a software conference&hellip; it works.</p>

<h3>Meal Time</h3>

<p>Lunch was served by the entire Madison restaurant community. Gift certificates were supplied by Engine Yard, and the certificates were redeemable for meals at local restaurants.  What a wonderful way to put serendipity to work! Attendees who just met formed clusters of lunch parties on a whim. The conversations were rich.</p>

<h3>After-Hours Gatherings</h3>

<p>Thursday night&rsquo;s gathering, <a href="http://hypeharvest.com/">Hype Harvest</a>, had elements of a party but it was so much more. Hype Harvest was held on the roof of the Madison Museum of Modern Art, and it served multiple purposes. First, to raise funds for Nairobi Dev School, founded by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/tech/teenager-hacker-school-africa-google">Martha Chumo</a>, a 19-year-old software developer in Nairobi, Kenya. Second, to give everyone a taste of the presenters to come. Third, to let the attendees gather, renew old friendships, and begin new ones.</p>

<p>Friday night&rsquo;s party was held at <a href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>. An outdoor concert ran concurrently in the middle of the street next to the office. Bendyworks guests had the best seats around because the second floor office sits right above the musical stage.</p>

<h3>Madison Ruby and My Brother</h3>

<p>As an organizer of WindyCityRails, my relationship with Madison Ruby reminds me of my relationship with my brother, <a href="http://motoringventures.com">Edward Hightower</a>, while we were growing up. Edward and I are one year apart, and we competed aggressively in every way: On the swim team, in the <a href="http://troop534.org">Boy Scouts</a>, in academics&hellip; you name it. Through the competition, we learned to love and respect each other. My brother Edward is one of my closest friends. That doesn&rsquo;t always happen with family!</p>

<p>Madison Ruby competes with WindyCityRails. At the same time, I enjoy the trip to Madison because I get so much from the experience. Congratulations to the Madison Ruby organizer team for running a great event three years in a row. I plan to return next year.</p>
