    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boy Scout <a href="http://troop534.org">Troop 534</a> &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; asked me to speak at the Troop&rsquo;s annual reunion breakfast this year. This was a big deal for me because I grew up in the troop, I currently serve as one of the adult leaders, and the breakfast organizers normally invite an outsider to speak. Why listen to a speaker who you see all the time?</p>

<p>I took the speaking invitation as a challenge to come up with some new material.</p>

<h3>Three Stories</h3>

<p>Teenagers are a tough audience. I chose to approach them with three stories centered around the theme of <em>Specialized Knowledge and the Courage to Execute</em>. What a boring title! But the three stories appealed to the group. Here&rsquo;s a summary of the first story:</p>

<blockquote><p>The owner of a tractor company makes a life-changing decision when the founder of the Ferrari car company, Mr. Enzo Ferrari, pisses him off.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the 11-minute video. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you Troop 534 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; for having me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/parallella-portable.png' width='' height='' alt='Portability for Parallella-sized devices.' title='Portability for Parallella-sized devices.'><span class='caption-text'>Portability for Parallella-sized devices.</span></span>
<a href="/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-running-ruby-on-rails/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/preparing-for-parallella-64-cores-installing-go-on-mac-os-x/">Parallella</a> are three small, powerful Linux-based computers. But in order to make these devices truly portable, we need a way to carry a monitor and keyboard along. This article describes one hack that works.</p>

<h3>Inspiration in a Suitcase</h3>

<p>The HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab gave me my first exposure to assembler language. I was eighteen, working my first software internship, and loving every minute of it. When I devised ways to complete my <em>regular work</em> faster than management expected, I had some time on my hands. So I spent time learning assembler with the HP 5036.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/hp-5036.png' width='' height='' alt='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab' title='HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab'><span class='caption-text'>HP 5036 Microprocessor Lab</span></span></p>

<p>The entire 5036 fits in a suitcase&hellip; how cool is that! Here&rsquo;s how the 5036 works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing assembler-level code by hand on paper.</li>
<li>Grab the reference book for the microprocessor running on the
board, Intel 8080.</li>
<li>For each assembler-level command, find the corresponding 2-digit
hexidecimal operation code.</li>
<li>Key the op code into the 5036 by hand.</li>
<li>Run the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Working with the 5036 was addictive in a positive way. In a subsequent job, where I wrote assembler to drive hardware devices, I was ready.</p>

<h3>Portability Needed</h3>

<p>Fast forward a few decades. We now have the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella. Wonderful devices with one flaw in common: No portability. That&rsquo;s when I had a flashback to my days with the 5036.</p>

<p>I bought a $35 technician box from Home Depot and I ripped out the insides. Micro Center had 720p LCD monitors on sale for $90, so I bought one of those. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the extra bucks for a 1080p LCD because you never know how something like this might work out! Finally, I topped everything off with a $25 keyboard/trackpad combo from Amazon.  The result appears in the photo at the top of this article. Special thanks to Ericka [last name unknown] from Home Depot who gave me tons of ideas on how to securely fasten the monitor to the case.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why did I spend the time and money to assemble this kit? It&rsquo;s all about learning. Devs learn more when we interact with other devs &ndash; people who are learning some of the same things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with. And sometimes the things we need to learn are too new for books.</p>

<p>By carrying my Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, and Parallella with me in a portable unit, I can share my experiences with other devs and learn more in the process. Everybody wins when that happens.</p>

<h3>Thanks SCNA!</h3>

<p>The organizers of <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA)</a> gave me the opportunity to present this story as a lightning talk at the conference. Slides are here:</p>

<p>Thank you SCNA! As I shared with the other devs at SCNA, I will gladly post my mistakes and <em>gotchas</em> here for people who want to build a unit like this. Let&rsquo;s build!</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2013/10/31/tohtml-using-vim-code-snippets-in-keynote-presentations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While finishing my presentation for the upcoming <a href="http://chippewavalleycodecamp.com/">Chippewa Valley Code Camp</a>, I decided to add some blocks of code to my slides. I forgot the name of the tool I used for my last slide deck, and it took several minutes of Google-fu to find it.</p>

<p>Google led me back to <code>:TOhtml</code>. Whew! I&rsquo;m documenting <code>:TOhtml</code> here to avoid wasting time with a future search.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Start With a Block of Code</h3>

<p>Fire up Vim and drop the block of code you want to convert into a new Vim buffer. In this example, I&rsquo;ve created a sample <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/">RubyMotion</a> OS X app, and I want to show the contents of the Rakefile.</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>&ndash;<em>&ndash; coding: utf-8 &ndash;</em>&ndash;</h1>

<p>$:.unshift(&ldquo;/Library/RubyMotion/lib&rdquo;)
require &lsquo;motion/project/template/osx&rsquo;</p>

<p>begin
  require &lsquo;bundler&rsquo;
  Bundler.require
rescue LoadError
end</p>

<p>Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # Use `rake config' to see complete project settings.
  app.name = &lsquo;EjectDisks&rsquo;
  app.info_plist[&lsquo;LSUIElement&rsquo;] = true
end
```</p>

<p>Next, visually select the lines you want to convert. You can do this with shift-V, or with the (gasp!) mouse. Or if you want to convert the entire file, enter <code>:TOhtml</code> in the command area. Vim will convert the highlighted text into HTML in a new buffer. Here&rsquo;s the result:</p>

<p>```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &ldquo;&ndash;//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd</a>&rdquo;>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

<meta name="syntax" content="ruby">
<meta name="settings" content="number_lines,use_css,no_foldcolumn,expand_tabs,line_ids,prevent_copy=">
<meta name="colorscheme" content="darkspectrum"></p>





<script type='text/javascript'>
<!--

/* function to open any folds containing a jumped-to line before jumping to it */
function JumpToLine()
{
  var lineNum;
  lineNum = window.location.hash;
  lineNum = lineNum.substr(1); /* strip off '#' */

  if (lineNum.indexOf('L') == -1) {
    lineNum = 'L'+lineNum;
  }
  lineElem = document.getElementById(lineNum);
  /* Always jump to new location even if the line was hidden inside a fold, or
   * we corrected the raw number to a line ID.
   */
  if (lineElem) {
    lineElem.scrollIntoView(true);
  }
  return true;
}
if ('onhashchange' in window) {
  window.onhashchange = JumpToLine;
}

-->
</script>

</pre>


<p></body>
</html></p>

<!-- vim: set foldmethod=manual : -->


<p>```</p>

<p>Save the new buffer as <code>~/Desktop/convertedstuff.html</code> or any other file name that you choose. In this case, I chose:</p>

<p><code>
:w ~/Desktop/convertedrakefile.html
</code></p>

<p>Open the converted file in a web browser.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/rakefile-browser.png' width='' height='' alt='Rakefile in Chrome.' title='Rakefile in Chrome.'><span class='caption-text'>Rakefile in Chrome.</span></span></p>

<p>Copy and paste the text from the browser into Keynote.</p>

<h3>Washed Out Code?</h3>

<p>If the code looks washed out when you paste it into Keynote, you have a few alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a different theme in Vim at the beginning, or</li>
<li>Darken/lighten the background in Keynote by using the Keynote inspector.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Finished Slide</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the finished product looks like. All the clarity of syntax-highlighted text. You can even adjust font size at will using the Keynote inspector. All set for the presentation.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='/images/osxfinished.png' width='' height='' alt='The final snippet, in Keynote.' title='The final snippet, in Keynote.'><span class='caption-text'>The final snippet, in Keynote.</span></span></p>

<h3>Easier Way?</h3>

<p>Can this process be simplified? If you know the answer, feel free to mention it in the comments below. Thanks!</p>

Planet Earth is facing a shortage of people who make things. People like scientists, software developers, architects, and  engineers. People who use their brains and hands to make greatness happen.</p>

<p>To increase the world&rsquo;s supply of problem solvers, the organizers of <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> partnered with a group of energetic college students, the founders of <a href="http://hackthemonkey.com">Monkey Bars</a>. The result: Together, we launched the first WindyCityRails Youth Program featuring the Arduino microcontroller.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Video Summary</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the launch video:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://RayHightower.com//player.vimeo.com/video/74022351" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The youth who participated in the program were engaged and enthusiastic. The Monkey Bars team introduced the youth to the Arduino micro-controller and related hardware.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, parents arrived to take their kids home, and the kids were reluctant to leave! They were absorbed in their Arduino projects. Even better, friendships formed between the youth participants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to think about the new companies that may have been launched that day!</p>

<h3>Next Year</h3>

<p>Planning for next year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails, including the Youth Program, is currently underway. If there are things you&rsquo;d like to see in next year&rsquo;s program, feel free to <a href="http://windycityrails.org/contact">contact the WindyCityRails organizers</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From a video interview with Steve Jobs:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little money.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.<!--more--></p>

<p>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people who are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build other things that other people can use.</p>

<p>Once you learn that, you&rsquo;ll never be the same again.</p></blockquote>
